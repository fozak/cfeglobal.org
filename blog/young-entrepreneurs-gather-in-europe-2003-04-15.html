With the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurs%27_Organization'>Young Entrepreneurs' Organization</a>'s (YEO) European membership growing at such an accelerated pace, this special YEO conference provided members with the chance to meet and network with their worldwide entrepreneurial peers. Many of the program's speakers talked on the theme: 'European Entrepreneurship: A New Reality -- the passion of business in Europe.' Profiled speakers included <a href='/people/pierre-cuilleret'>Pierre Cuilleret</a>, founder of The Phonehouse; <a href='/people/mark-dixon'>Mark Dixon</a>, founder of Regus; Glen Travers, biotech entrepreneur; and boat designer <a href='/people/bertrand-vogele'>Bertrand Vogele</a> of ACM. Other speakers at the three-day conference included real estate investor <a href='/people/jean-francois-ott'>Jean-Francois Ott</a>; <a href='/people/verne-harnish'>Verne Harnish</a>, CEO of Gazelles, Inc.; <a href='/people/gary-hoover'>Gary Hoover</a>, founder of Hoovers Online and Bookstop; <a href='/people/robert-benninga'>Robert Benninga</a>, founder Mind Power International; Frank Mermoud from the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (trade), U.S. Department of State; as well as heavyweight boxer <a href='/people/arnold-vanderlyde'>Arnold Vanderlyde</a>, an Olympic silver medalist, who drew parallels between success in sports and success in business. The conference opened with a welcoming reception at the residence of the U.S. Ambassador of France Howard H. Leach. There was also a Peer-to-Peer Exchange -- a dialogue among participants in a round-table-style setting, and a Lessons-From-the-Edge Panel, where participants had the opportunity to hear and tell business stories by people who have been to the edge, overcome monumental hurdles, and not only survived, but thrived in their businesses. 'The Paris conference was the strongest event in Europe to take place to date,' stated Brien Biondi, chief executive officer of YEO. 'The high-quality learning program was very well received by all who attended. We look forward to the 2003 European Conference taking place in another exciting location.'
