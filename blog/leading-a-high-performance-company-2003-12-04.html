Now, as your business expands, you face new challenges that require more and more of your time and resources. One of the best investments you can make to ensure the success of your growing company is to invest in yourself as a leader. By boosting your performance as a leader, you boost the performance of your company by creating a team ready to overcome obstacles and take your company to new levels of success. Leading a High Performance Company focuses on you, the entrepreneur, and your company’s growth potential. Discover how to get the most out of your company and your people at this dynamic workshop, where you will learn the four major components of being a leader of a high performance company: Setting a strong example; Learning to delegate effectively; Measuring the performance of your company and your team; and Rewarding and promoting your best people. Finally, we will also discuss how to de-motivate employees, so that you won’t! The Leading a High Performance Company workshop begins with a presentation, followed by an interactive discussion and problem-solving session, and ends with the creation of a Personal Action Plan that you can use immediately. A networking reception with your fellow entrepreneurs immediately follows the session.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Key Organizations and Facilitator Information</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>Dr. Jana Matthews is an expert on entrepreneurial leadership, and has written or co-authored six books.
