It was initiated by The Center for Entrepreneurship which organized a working group meeting attended by about 20 leading universities, business schools, and entrepreneurs involved in training. The template for the Association was the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Association_for_Small_Business_and_Entrepreneurship'>United States Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship (USASBE)</a>, which has been successfully operating in the USA for 52 years. <a href='/people/geralyn-franklin'>Geralyn Franklin</a>, President of USASBE, and Dean of the College of Business at the University of South Florida, came specifically to tell her colleagues about the structure of USASBE, an organization that unites about 800 people disseminating knowledge about SMEs and entrepreneurship. They include scholars, authors of training courses in psychology and dramatic art, as well as professors of classical business subjects. USASBE members are entitled to free journals and information bulletins in the field of entrepreneurship; they improve their skills at seminars and workshops; and they meet annually for a major conference in various US cities. USASBE is part of the International Council for Small Business. Following the above model, the Association for Entrepreneurship Education will be able to identify the best programs and use them to establish higher levels of training. Association members will regularly take part in <a href='/programs/global-entrepreneurship-week'>Global Entrepreneurship Week</a> thus creating a bridge via which the most up-to-date entrepreneurial knowledge will enter this country. <a href='/people/ludmila-murgulets'>Ludmila Murgulets</a>, Vice President of the Stockholm School of Economics, has been elected President of the Association for Entrepreneurship Education.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Organizations Involved in Entrepreneurship Education</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Association_for_Small_Business_and_Entrepreneurship'>United States Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship (USASBE)</a> is dedicated to advancing the theory, practice, and significance of entrepreneurship and small business. Founded in 1957, USASBE is an inclusive community of educators, researchers, and practitioners who are seeking to enhance entrepreneurial outcomes on a global scale. One of its key offerings is the annual conference that brings together top minds in entrepreneurship to share their research and teaching practices. USASBE also provides various resources such as journals, information bulletins, and professional development opportunities. Members benefit from a network of peers, access to cutting-edge research, and insights into the latest trends affecting small businesses and entrepreneurs.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
