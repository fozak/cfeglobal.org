The B20 summit, traditionally part of the G20, aims to provide recommendations to the G20 leaders and serves as a global business community platform.

Industry 5.0 was discussed extensively, highlighting the shift towards integrated human-machine collaboration. The attendees included high-profile business leaders and government officials who emphasized the necessity of implementing policies that support innovation and entrepreneurship. A significant part of the discussions also revolved around the need for skilled workforce and educational programs tailored to the demands of the future market.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Also at the Meeting</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>The B20 forum included numerous stakeholders that play pivotal roles in global economic governance and business leadership. Notable among these were <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_20'>(B20)</a> which serves as the G20’s official voice of the private sector.
