YEO and CFE are working together to further entrepreneurship by introducing entrepreneurs to the extensive networking and knowledge resources of YEO. To introduce these benefits, CFE recruited four entrepreneurs to be local YEO charter members and accompanied them to YEO's European Conference in Paris, France in November 2002. These charter members are now working with CFE to bring in new members and to establish the first-ever YEO Chapter, which officially launches on February 6, 2003, with a special ceremony. Plans are also underway to hold YEO's European Conference in September 2003.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>About the Young Entrepreneurs Organization and Center for Entrepreneurship</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurs_Organization'>Young Entrepreneurs Organization (YEO)</a> is the premier, peer-to-peer, global community, network, and resource for entrepreneurs. Since 1987, this international nonprofit educational organization has helped its members build upon their successes through an array of learning and networking opportunities. With members in more than 142 cities spanning 35 countries, YEO's rapidly expanding membership includes entrepreneurs from every size and type of business. Membership in YEO is by invitation only and is subject to approval by both YEO International and the sponsoring local chapter.
