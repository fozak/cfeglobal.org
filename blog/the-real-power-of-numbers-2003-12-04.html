Entrepreneurs who really understand what is behind the numbers of their companies are more credible business leaders and thus are far more likely to get the funding they need to build their firms. Consequently, it is critical for entrepreneurs to understand and speak intelligently about their financial statements and the key performance metrics and ratios that are essential to their businesses, as well as about the set of key assumptions that form the basis for their financial projections. Entrepreneurs usually have a good “feel” for their businesses. They know their products and markets, and they can manage people. Too often, however, entrepreneurs view financials as necessary but tedious and uninteresting aspects of their businesses that someone else, like an accountant, ought to deal with. But research shows that the most successful entrepreneurs demonstrate real financial know-how about the critical numbers in their companies. They recognize that financial statements are valuable sources of information, powerful planning mechanisms and essential tools for managing and growing their businesses faster and more profitably.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>About The Center for Entrepreneurship</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'><a href='/people/allan-edwin'>Allan Edwin, Ph.D.</a>, is President of Edwin & Associates, which specializes in strategic and business planning; joint venture and strategic partnership negotiation; conflict resolution; capital formation; and operational consulting. As an entrepreneur, Mr. Edwin started and was CEO for 10 years of Interactive Systems, Inc., a computer and communications company that he managed through three rounds of venture funding, and its acquisition by 3M. Mr. Edwin is a Fellow of the Foundation for Enterprise Development, which has extensive experience in designing and delivering entrepreneurship programs worldwide. This workshop provides entrepreneurs the tools to use financial statements in running and expanding their businesses, read, understand and use critical financial information, model their businesses, detect business problems early, improve forecasting abilities, create flash reports, and present financial information more effectively. In addition to relevant examples and case studies, the program utilizes questionnaires and worksheets so that each entrepreneur walks away with a customized set of financial tools that he or she can use to help build their companies.
