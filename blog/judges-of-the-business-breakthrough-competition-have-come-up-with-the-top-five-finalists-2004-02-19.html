The winner is to be determined by the results of the second round in February. The Business Breakthrough competition, a joint project of our magazine and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurs%27_Organization'>The Center for Entrepreneurship</a>, aims at highlighting the experiences of young and fast-growing companies. The main prize of the competition is a two-week business exchange trip to the United States, where a US counterpart company will be selected in the same industry as the winner. Each participant was awarded points on the basis of a system specifically designed for the competition by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prado_Group'>Prado Group</a>. The five companies that scored the most points reached the second round. Regretfully, some contestants failed to completely fill out the questionnaire and were awarded fewer total points.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>More about Key Organizations</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Abris'>Alan Abris</a>, the top-scoring company with 13.31 points, is known for manufacturing a range of industrial products including repair and testing of valves and fittings, packaging, and mobile communication accessories. Founded in 2000, Alan Abris has expanded its operations significantly and reported a turnover of $1.2 million by 2002. Its success is attributed to investments in new production facilities and the development of patent-protected mobile communication accessories, unique globally. Internet-based sales within various regions further contributed to its market leadership. Alan Abris exemplifies how flexible manufacturing techniques can meet changing market situations.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
