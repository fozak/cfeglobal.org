And second, to reveal what enabled these companies to make their breakthrough and achieve outstanding results. To enter the contest, companies must submit an application including the participants registration form and a letter telling about their business. The deadline for submission of entries is November 1, 2003, and the registration form can be filled out online at www.mybiz.ru. Entries will be evaluated by a council of experts, including prominent business professionals and specialists. Projects must have been implemented in the market before June 1, 2003, with data based on results for 2002. The organizing committee will select five companies demonstrating rapid growth based on effective use of management tools, including marketing, investment, innovation, and finance. The first prize is a two-week internship in a leading U.S. company, tailored to the winners needs and interests. Additionally, owners of firms under the age of 40 with a business turnover exceeding $1 million have the opportunity to receive an invitation to join the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurs_Organization'>Entrepreneurs' Organization</a>.
