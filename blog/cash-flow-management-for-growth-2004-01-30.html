While most businesses never make it past the start-up stage, you beat the odds. However, after initial success, you now find that a lack of cash is inhibiting your company’s growth: affecting strategic planning, product development, and sales. For your company to grow, cash needs to be available to help managers develop and implement strategy, to fund new products, and to finance sales and marketing campaigns. With a proper understanding of cash flow management, you can help ensure that your employees have the resources they need to grow your company. Cash Flow Management for Growth teaches entrepreneurs how to solve the cash flow problems faced by growing businesses. The seminar begins with the difference between profit and cash, followed by interactive discussion and problem-solving sessions on the sources and uses of cash in a growth business, the use of the right financial ratios to measure and monitor cash flow, and the relationship between growth and cash flow. Working with other entrepreneurs you will analyze a case study about a company in a cash flow crisis and develop operational strategies and tactics to help the company survive. This workshop focuses on you, the entrepreneur, and your understanding of the impact of cash flow on your company’s growth.
