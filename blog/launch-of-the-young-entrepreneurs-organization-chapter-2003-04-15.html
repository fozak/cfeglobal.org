The chapter was officially launched on February 6, 2003 with a reception attended by YEO members, potential members, government officials, as well as the media. YEO, through its educational and networking activities, assists young entrepreneurs in building their companies. YEO members must be younger than 39, and be a founder or co-founder, owner or controlling shareholder of a company with gross annual sales that exceed $1 million. While some YEO members own companies with sales over $1 billion, the typical company revenue is $9 million. The Center for Entrepreneurship recruited four entrepreneurs to be founding members of the chapter and accompanied them to YEOs European Conference in Paris, France. The Center is assisting in developing and implementing the chapters learning programs and is co-sponsoring <a href='/programs/global-entrepreneurship-week'>Global Entrepreneurship Week</a> where 250 entrepreneurs from Europe and around the world will gather to meet with their counterparts for learning and networking events.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Educational and Networking Initiatives</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurs%27_Organization'>Young Entrepreneurs Organization</a> is a global network that supports young business leaders.
