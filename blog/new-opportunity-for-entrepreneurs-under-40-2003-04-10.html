Only a select few under-40s can apply to join. The YEO helps business owners under the age of 40 worldwide and plans to spend several hundred thousand dollars over the next five years to support the youngest chapter. To qualify, a prospective YEO member must be under 40 years of age and be a founder, co-founder, owner, or controlling shareholder of a business with gross annual revenues exceeding $1 million. Membership in the YEO, which is invite-only, is subject to approval by both YEO International and the sponsoring local chapter. Members graduate from the YEO in the year they turn 40 and are then encouraged to join the World Entrepreneurs Organization. The Center for Entrepreneurship director, <a href='/people/patricia-cloherty'>Patricia M. Cloherty</a>, was equally upbeat about the program. </p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>About the Young Entrepreneurs' Organization</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurs_Organization'>The Young Entrepreneurs Organization</a> (YEO) is a dynamic global network of young businesspeople.
