Your challenges are compounded by the rapidly changing and turbulent environment in which your firm operates. To survive and prosper in such settings, you must learn to think strategically about the forces impacting your organization and the actions you must take in response. Thus, strategic planning is concerned with envisioning how markets are evolving and deciding how best to procure and allocate resources which can help you to be a player in those markets. An Entrepreneur’s Guide to Strategic Planning is a workshop designed to provide participants with hands-on training in methods used to support effective strategic decision making. Strategic decisions are those which define a firm’s future direction and shape the necessary allocation of resources to attain longer term objectives. Participants will have the opportunity to work with and apply various strategic tools and techniques to their own organizational situations. Particular emphasis will be placed upon tools for evaluating your firm’s external environment for critical opportunities and threats and internal environment for an assessment of key strengths and weaknesses. You will use the insights generated from these tools to formulate a strategic vision for your organization and a strategic plan designed to attain that vision. This program is designed for entrepreneurs, founders, and CEOs of growing organizations who wish to bring new products and services into the marketplace through innovation and creativity. Are currently seeking new avenues for growth. Desire to move their companies to pursue new opportunities within their existing markets. The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Strategic Planning workshop will encompass a series of lectures, discussions, experiential exercises and a case study all designed to enable you to introduce a culture of strategic thinking into your own organization. From this experience, you will take away a set of tools you can use with your own people to develop a comprehensive strategic assessment of where your firm is today, where it desires to be tomorrow and action plans to get you from here to there, and the knowledge to implement those tools.
