At the event, <a href='/people/patricia-cloherty'>Patricia M. Cloherty</a> discussed the unique opportunities YEO provides its members. YEO is the fastest-growing worldwide organization of entrepreneurs, created to foster development, education, and peer support. Membership requires being a founder or co-founder of a business with at least $1,000,000 in annual turnover and being under the age of 40. The organization's aim is to provide valuable on-the-ground experience and peer support, which is often missing from theoretical consultant advice. During conferences, members can share knowledge, establish ties, and access YEO's website for unique business information. The educational programs, or 'universities,' held several times a year, offer insights into launching new projects and attracting investors. Members can ask for help at any time and participate in forums and open communication events on various business-related topics. These initiatives help members feel supported and connected, proving extremely valuable for any entrepreneur.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Key Organizations Making a Difference</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurs%27_Organization'>Entrepreneurs Organization</a> is a global network that fosters development, education, and peer support among entrepreneurs.
