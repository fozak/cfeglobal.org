<h3 data-semantic="blog-subtitle1">Connecting Entrepreneurs Across Borders</h3>
<p data-semantic="blog-main-text">
                            Recognizing an opportunity for expanded international cooperation, the <a href="/partners/center-for-entrepreneurship">Center for Entrepreneurship</a> (CFE) and the <a href="/partners/foundation-for-enterprise-development">Foundation for Enterprise Development</a> (FED), in partnership with the <a href="/partners/young-entrepreneurs-organization">Young Entrepreneurs Organization</a> (YEO), are hosting the U.S. Entrepreneurs Exchange, a peer-learning program that links entrepreneurs from various countries, from May 29 through June 6, 2003. The program will take place in five cities across the United States.
                            Six international entrepreneurs from fast-growing companies will be matched with U.S.-based business leaders from similar industries. The goal of the Entrepreneurs Exchange is to immerse participants in the American entrepreneurial culture and expose their American hosts to diverse business cultures.
                            “It’s a way to build relationships between entrepreneurs within a shared industry sector as a foundation for future business opportunities or trade,” said <a href="/people/ray-smilor">Ray Smilor</a>, president of the Center for Entrepreneurship. “By sharing ideas and strategies, participants can learn from each other and build better, higher-performing organizations.”
                            The program will bring together industry leaders from varied backgrounds, including food, public relations, finance, television production, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals, providing them with an intensive hands-on experience in their respective fields.
                            U.S. participants will include <a href="/people/ashley-postlewaite">Ashley Postlewaite</a>, CEO of <a href="/partners/renegade-animation">Renegade Animation, Inc.</a>; <a href="/people/christopher-rosica">Christopher Rosica</a>, CEO of <a href="/partners/rosica-mulhern">Rosica Mulhern, Inc.</a>; <a href="/people/joe-polo">Joe Polo</a>, CEO of <a href="/partners/original-juan">Original Juan</a>; <a href="/people/jonathan-slater">Jonathan Slater</a>, CEO of <a href="/partners/sequel-management">Sequel Management</a>; <a href="/people/james-weldon">James Weldon</a>, CEO of <a href="/partners/max-displays">MaxDisplays.com</a>; and <a href="/people/monique-muri">Monique Muri</a>, CEO of <a href="/partners/ram-scientific">Ram Scientific Corp.</a>.
                            “It became apparent that there was a need for a forum which would allow entrepreneurs to talk to, share ideas with, and get advice from other entrepreneurs across borders,” said <a href="/people/victor-sedov">Victor Sedov</a>, Executive Director of the Center for Entrepreneurship. “The most important thing is a collaborative learning process where people are learning from each other.” 
                            Participants are chosen through a competitive application process and then selected by a joint committee of FED and CFE. The international entrepreneurs arrive in Washington, D.C. on May 29 to meet the U.S. participants and will then spend the next nine days with their U.S. host companies located in Boston, New York, Kansas City, Burbank, and San Jose.
                        </p>
