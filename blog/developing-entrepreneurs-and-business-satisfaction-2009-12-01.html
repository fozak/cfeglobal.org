Entrepreneurs turned out to be the happiest Americans as perceived by themselves. The younger generation has a very good entrepreneurial potential. They don't have the legacy of the past, which threatened entrepreneurs. They are strong, enthusiastic, and confident of success. Studies indicate that the desire to start up a business declines dramatically among people older than 25, because they are much more prudent in weighing all the risks of enterprise, and realize the complexity of running a business. To meet ambitious goals, entrepreneurship education should be taken seriously and the younger generation should be shown instruments to help them in their entrepreneurial ambitions. Entrepreneurial skills are like a sail that must be driven by wind - circumstances, chance, luck. But the boat is not going anywhere without the sail. The international competition, <a href='https://www.ey.com/en_gl/weoy'>Entrepreneur of the Year</a>, supported by <a href='https://www.ey.com/en_gl'>Ernst & Young</a>, has been held in 50 countries for over 20 years. Winners are determined by the unanimous decision of a national jury, including previous winners, independent experts, and prominent businesspeople.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Key Programs and Organizations</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>The <a href='https://www.ey.com/en_gl'>Ernst & Young</a> Entrepreneur of the Year awards inspire and set a positive example for everyone engaged in small business activities. This competition highlights the achievements of outstanding entrepreneurs, with criteria including quantitative factors like the growth rate of a company&rsquo;s turnover, profit, and the number of jobs created, and qualitative aspects like the degree of innovation, the development of original products, creative marketing and sales solutions, and the scale of national and international presence. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurs%27_Organization'>Entrepreneurs' Organization</a> is another significant player in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, providing a global network of business owners who support each other through various stages of business development. The <a href='/programs/scaleup-club'>Scaleup Club</a> and <a href='/programs/dynamic-entrepreneurship-classroom'>Dynamic Entrepreneurship Classroom</a> programs help individuals grow their existing businesses and develop new skills. These initiatives contribute significantly to the overall climate of entrepreneurship by offering educational resources, funding opportunities, and a supportive community. The fusion of practical training, financial support, and mentorship through these programs ensures that aspiring entrepreneurs have all the tools they need to succeed.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
