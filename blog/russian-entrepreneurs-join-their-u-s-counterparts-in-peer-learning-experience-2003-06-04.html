The program will take place in five cities across the United States. Six Russian entrepreneurs from fast-growing companies will be matched with U.S.-based business leaders from similar industries. The goal of the Entrepreneurs Exchange is to immerse Russian entrepreneurs in the American entrepreneurial culture, and expose their American hosts to the business culture of Russia. “It’s a way to build relationships between entrepreneurs within a shared industry sector as a foundation for future business opportunities or trade,” said <a href='/people/ray-smilor'>Ray Smilor</a>, president of the Foundation for Enterprise Development. “By sharing ideas and strategies, participants can learn from each other and build better, higher performing organizations.” The program will bring together industry leaders from varied backgrounds, including food, public relations, finance, television production, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals, providing them with an intensive hands-on experience in their respective fields. Participants are chosen through a competitive application process and then selected by a joint committee of FED and The Center for Entrepreneurship. The U.S. participants will include Ashley Postlewaite, CEO of Renegade Animation, Inc.; <a href='/people/christopher-rosica'>Christopher Rosica</a>, CEO of Rosica Mulhern, Inc.; Joe Polo, CEO of Original Juan; Jonathan Slater, CEO of Sequel Management; James Weldon, CEO of MaxDisplays.com; and Monique Muri, CEO of Ram Scientific Corp.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>About Key Organizations</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Entrepreneurship'>Foundation for Enterprise Development</a> is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing entrepreneurship through education, training, and consulting.
