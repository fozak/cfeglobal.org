By focusing on the unique marketing challenges and opportunities in fast-growth, entrepreneurial firms, this workshop shows entrepreneurs how to utilize innovative, powerful and cost-effective marketing techniques to win customers and capture markets. Great marketing begins with a fundamental understanding of your market. Consequently, this workshop addresses what entrepreneurs need to know about their customers and provides practical tools for helping entrepreneurs gain and keep customers! By revealing key trends in the emerging marketplace and explaining what they mean, the program helps entrepreneurs develop and implement successful marketing strategies and tactics. The workshop introduces entrepreneurs to a simple but powerful framework for organizing their marketing activities in a customer-centered manner. It provides entrepreneurs with a practical and effective way to deal with the full-range of marketing decision variables to significantly enhance the value creating capabilities in their firms. In addition, the workshop presents methods and techniques for discovering new sources of customer value in areas that entrepreneurs often overlook. The workshop shows entrepreneurs how to utilize guerrilla marketing approaches to achieve high impact marketing results without spending large amounts of money. Entrepreneurs can thus enhance their abilities to leverage resources, stretch resources, discover under-utilized resources and create their own resources. In addition, by providing examples of a variety of guerrilla methods, the workshop will show entrepreneurs ways in which marketing can be used creatively to mitigate and manage the risks facing their firms. Too many entrepreneurs take a reactive and tactical approach to marketing. This workshop shows entrepreneurs how to be more proactive and strategic –and thus far more effective – in developing and implementing their firms’ entire marketing program. In the process, entrepreneurs come to better understand the need for a close relationship between their customers’ buying process and their firm’s selling process. In addition to relevant examples and case studies, the program utilizes questionnaires and worksheets so that each entrepreneur walks away with a customized marketing plan that he or she can use to build their companies. Through this program, entrepreneurs will learn how the right entrepreneurial marketing approach can lead to more profitable enterprises.
