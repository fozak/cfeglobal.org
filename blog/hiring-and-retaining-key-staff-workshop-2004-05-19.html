As a business owner, you may wonder, “Why can’t we hire the right people?” or “Why are the people we want to stay leaving?” This seminar will show you how to get outstanding people onboard, and how to ensure their goals are aligned with yours. You will learn how to create a company where your best people want to stay and help you grow. The Hiring and Retaining Key Staff workshop was developed by entrepreneurship expert, <a href='/people/jana-matthews'>Dr. Jana Matthews</a>, and addresses the essential issues of finding and keeping the best people in your company. The hiring process can get derailed in many places. In this seminar, you’ll learn to solve the common challenges of hiring, by developing a hiring process that works. You will review your own hiring process, assess its strengths and weaknesses, and identify changes that need to be made. Who should be moved from potential candidates to finalists? What red flags should we be watching for during the hiring process? Knowing how to find the right people is just the beginning. You must be able to identify your key staff and retain them (and assess who might need to leave.) This seminar will teach many of the ways to retain key staff and enable them to be peak performers. The seminar provides tools you can use in your company immediately to develop better job descriptions, conduct hiring interviews, and perform reference checks. We’ll review a matrix of Performance and Values, develop a performance improvement plan, and discuss ways to have that difficult discussion with an employee – when you tell them they need to leave. The seminar concludes with the creation of a Personal Action Plan that will prioritize changes you’ll need to make in your company.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Key Organizations</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder'>Boulder Quantum Ventures</a> is led by Dr. Jana Matthews, who has extensive experience with the challenges of business growth.
