The chapter was officially launched on February 6, 2003, with a reception attended by YEO members, potential members, government officials, and the media. <a href='/people/sean-magennis'>Sean Magennis</a>, YEO President, highlighted the importance of educational and networking activities offered by the organization to assist young entrepreneurs in building their companies. YEO members must be younger than 39 and be founders, co-founders, owners, or controlling shareholders of companies with gross annual sales exceeding $1 million. Typical company revenues among members average $9 million, although some member companies boast sales over $1 billion. The Center for Entrepreneurship recruited four entrepreneurs to be founding members of the chapter and accompanied them to YEOs European Conference in Paris, France. The organization assists in developing and implementing the chapter's learning programs and co-sponsored YEOs 2003 European Conference on October 10-12, 2003. During the event, 100 entrepreneurs from Europe and around the world gathered to meet with their counterparts for learning and networking events. YEO offers an excellent opportunity for entrepreneurs to network globally and expand their businesses.
