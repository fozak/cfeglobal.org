This program is not like others. It is easy to grow your existing business with the <a href='/programs/scaleup-acceleration-program'>Center for Entrepreneurship ScaleUp</a>. Scaleups are on an upward trajectory despite current economic conditions. After all, they are known for their agility and ability to pivot quickly in response to changing circumstances. These businesses have transitioned from the uncertainty of the startup phase and are on their way to more stable, sustained growth. They have cracked the formula for repeatable sales, have the right team, and are ready to expand into new markets or channels. Scaleups not only create jobs; they disrupt the market and their industry with innovations and nontraditional business models. However, scaling up requires a different mindset and skill set than starting up. Companies can lose some of the nimbleness of the startup phase while not yet achieving the relative stability of a large enterprise. In return, scaleups encounter new challenges that must be sorted out to move forward such as constraints on growth. Identifying and removing internal business model constraints on growth involve a rigorous approach that includes small-scale experimentation. Freedom versus standardization. While no one wants to lose the magic of the startup, scaleup must maintain a delicate balance between freedom and standardization to remain viable. For example, rules on which platform is used to communicate are imposed while payroll activities are governed by a predefined, auditable workflow. Skills mismatch. Sometimes, people who are instrumental during the startup phase do not have the skills and discipline needed for the scaleup phase. These exits are not easy, but having the right people in place at the right time is essential to success. Lost culture. Because the workforce has changed and expanded rapidly, sometimes from 10 to 100 to 1,000 employees, disorganization, fuzzy goals, and a lack of workforce unity often arise. The program is essential to fast and significant growth. Scaleups are more than just glorified startups. And by overcoming unique challenges and adopting the right strategies along the way, scaleups can achieve significant growth and drive job creation and innovation in modern commerce. Adopting the right program and skills at the right time is crucial for successful scaling. <a href='/partners/ewing-marion-kauffman-foundation'>Center for Entrepreneurship</a> invites you to apply for the 2025 ScaleUp program.</p><h4 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Key Program Benefits</h4><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>Why join the program?
