The program fosters personalized experience and enables mentors to provide advice not only on business issues but also general advice as many program participants are just beginning their careers. Mentors serve as a sounding board, provide a second opinion, share lessons from their experiences, and become a trusted long-term relationship. A mentor helps expand a new entrepreneur's business and social network and access to senior decision makers. This one year program includes pre-program training to introduce both mentors and mentees to the skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary to be effective in their respective roles. Over the course of the year, mentors and mentees meet twice a month and mentees are invited to participate in two <a href='/programs/entrepreneurship-groups'>CFE Entrepreneurship Groups</a> and two <a href='/programs/fasttrac'>CFE 4-hour open enrollment seminars</a> in order to provide a formal learning element to the program. To ensure the success of this program, The Center for Entrepreneurship has partnered with the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Business_Leaders_Forum'>International Business Leaders Forum</a> which lends their program experience in conducting mentoring programs in 37 countries worldwide.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Partner Organizations</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>The <a href='https://www.ey.com/en_us/entrepreneurial-winning-women'>Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Program</a> celebrates successful entrepreneurs, recognizing the positive impact they make in their communities and around the world. The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Business_Leaders_Forum'>International Business Leaders Forum</a> is a non-profit organization that has played a significant role in nurturing global entrepreneurship by providing resources and sharing expertise in over 37 countries. This collaboration underscores the importance of experienced mentorship for emerging entrepreneurs. The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka:_Innovators_for_the_Public'>Ashoka Foundation</a> also partners with The Center for Entrepreneurship, promoting social entrepreneurship and innovation. Their expansive network provides critical support systems for young entrepreneurs striving to make a difference. Such partnerships are key to The Center for Entrepreneurship's mission of fostering a supportive ecosystem for startups and growing businesses.</p></div></div></section></div></div>
