You have made the hard strategic decisions which define your firm’s future direction and shape the necessary allocation of resources to attain your longer-term objectives. You have crafted what looks to be a winning strategy, and are ready to sit back and let it happen. Right? Wrong! For those who can execute their strategy, the rewards are significant. However, it’s one thing to craft a winning strategy, but successfully implementing it is another thing entirely. Unfortunately, the vast majority of companies fail miserably when attempting to execute their strategies. What is needed to successfully implement strategy is a system that provides real insight into an organization’s operations, balances the historical accuracy of financial numbers with the real drivers of future performance, and helps align short-term actions with strategy. One system that does this is the Balanced Scorecard. In this seminar, Implementing the Balanced Scorecard, you will get an in-depth, hands-on examination of the powerful Balanced Scorecard system. You will be exposed to all key facets of the Balanced Scorecard model, allowing you to take full advantage of this breakthrough tool in your own organization. Through lecture, hands-on exercises, a real-life case study, and actual Balanced Scorecard success stories, you will learn: - How the Balanced Scorecard helps solve fundamental business issues; - How it “translates” vision and strategy into action; - How to define key performance measurement terms and concepts; - How to determine what to measure in each of the four Scorecard perspectives; and - How to communicate strategy on a strategy map. You will take away a set of tools you can use with your own strategy to develop a comprehensive set of balanced measurements to successfully drive your future results.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>About Paul R.
