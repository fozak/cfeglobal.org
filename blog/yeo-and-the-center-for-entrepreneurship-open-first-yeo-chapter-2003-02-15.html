YEO and The Center for Entrepreneurship have combined efforts to support entrepreneurship by giving entrepreneurs access to YEO's networks and resources. As part of this partnership, The Center for Entrepreneurship plans to provide financial, administrative, and organizational assistance to YEO and its chapters. YEO currently has 5,000 members, with an average age of 35 and average company revenue of $9 million per year. The organization has 120 chapters in 34 countries. Entrepreneurs under 40 who own, founded, or partner in a company with minimum revenues of $1 million per year can become members. The chapter expects over one thousand entrepreneurs in several years. The chapter president believes that by the end of 2003, 25-30 members will join. YEO branches are financed through annual fees, with membership costing $790 annually. There are also plans to open another branch office later in 2003. The Center for Entrepreneurship offers educational and networking opportunities to meet the needs of entrepreneurs of fast-growing companies.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Key Organizations Involved</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>The Young Entrepreneurs Organization (YEO) is a global network of young business owners, providing peer-to-peer learning and connections to enhance business growth.
