Become a Volunteer
A vibrant ecosystem helps communities thrive. assist in supporting the entrepreneurs that participate in our ScaleUp Accelerator Programs and Startup Club. We have several volunteer opportunities for you to choose from and would love to speak with you more about how you can be involved.

Mentor Entrepreneurs:
ScaleUp Accelerator Mentors use their business and leadership experience to guide new entrepreneurs through the process of growing business. Mentors work in teams and in pairs and are matched with an entrepreneur based on schedule availability and desire to work together. The team meets as a group to help reaffirm topics and themes raised during classes while also strategizing with the entrepreneur to reach their specific goals during the program. This is a high-touch 9 month commitment. Mentor has 90-minute monthly meetings.

Volunteer to moderate the Startup Club sessions
Center for Entreprenuership hosts a handful of dynamic Startup Club events throughout the year. 
Every session needs a good and positive moderator to lead the session.
