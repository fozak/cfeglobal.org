Since 2006, the Center for Entrepreneurship has been implementing the <a href='/programs/dynamic-entrepreneurship-classroom'>Dynamic Entrepreneurship Classroom (DEC)</a> program. More than 500 teachers from higher education institutions from 18 cities have taken part in the program, significantly influencing the promotion of entrepreneurship education in universities. Thanks to this initiative, over 80 new programs and entrepreneurial initiatives have appeared in more than 30 universities. DEC is designed as a three- or five-day seminar featuring leading experts in entrepreneurship education from Europe and the USA. It provides university teachers with an introduction to teaching entrepreneurship as a discipline, focusing on developing practical and business skills for future entrepreneurs. Participants benefit from pedagogical content, teaching methods, and opportunities to enhance their teaching skills. Key topics include why we teach entrepreneurship, what we teach, and how we teach it. Renowned expert <a href='/people/raymond-smilor'>Raymond Smilor</a>, a Professor at the Neeley School of Business at the University of Texas, has been a key partner in this program's development and running.</p><h4 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Key Organizations in Entrepreneurship Education</h4><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas'>University of Texas</a> at Austin is known for its strong emphasis on fostering entrepreneurial skills among its students.
