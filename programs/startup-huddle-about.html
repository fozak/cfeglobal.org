                     <p>The categories of AI are divided into two, namely:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Weak AI is an Artificial Intelligence that is trained for certain tasks. Such as Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant.</li>
                    <li>Strong AI is an AI system with general human cognitive abilities and can find solutions without human intervention.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Then, the types of AI are further divided into three types, namely neural AI, neural network, and symbol manipulating AI.</p>
                <p>The following is an example of the application of artificial intelligence that has been implemented and utilized in everyday life that we often encounter.</p>
                <h5>1. Humanoid Robot</h5>
                <p>A humanoid robot is a robot that is claimed to be able to learn from interactions with humans, then it will store data about the behavior of these interactions using cloud storage based on an AI system. One of them is a Humanoid Robot created by Softbank named Pepper, which has a height of 1 meter and a tablet on its chest.</p>

    Collaborative problem solving for startups “Startup Huddle”
    “Startup Huddle” – providing support to aspiring entrepreneurs through crowdsourcing with the involvement of participants in the entrepreneurial ecosystem in solving the problems of young businesses.
    
    Startup Huddle is an international program aimed at education, development and unity of entrepreneurial communities; one of the products of the Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN). Startup Huddle has been implemented worldwide since 2016.
    
    How it works
    
    Two pre-selected entrepreneurs present their business for 6 minutes and talk about current problems and goals for the future. After this, within 20 minutes, representatives of the entrepreneurial community provide feedback, options for solving the problem, valuable advice on further steps, and share their experience.
    
    The program is implemented by the Entrepreneurship Center through a wide partner network. The event is held once a month for 1.5 hours. Among the 20-30 representatives of the entrepreneurial community are investors, successful entrepreneurs, mentors, and media.

    Startup Huddle FAQ
What is Startup Huddle? 
Startup Huddle is a free, weekly or monthly educational program that gives one or two local startups the opportunity to crowdsource solutions to challenges they are facing. Each presenter gives a 6-minute presentation and engages in 20 minutes of Q+A with a room full of community members looking to give back and help local startups flourish.

Startup Huddles can occur at any time in the day, and at any point in the month, as long as it repeats its self on a consistent basis. As opposed to a traditional “pitch” environment, Startup Huddle was not created to be critical of entrepreneurs, but rather for the presenters to learn from shared experiences and find ways to support one another as a community. The culture surrounding Startup Huddle is that of a supportive, neutral space, welcoming entrepreneurs to be honest and open about their businesses and the challenges they face. It is also a valuable experience for the community, providing a unique opportunity to network with people from backgrounds one might not typically meet. 

 

How do I become a Startup Huddle organizer? 
First, check to make sure that there isn’t already a chapter in your community. If not, you can apply to organize a chapter. The Startup Huddle team will review your application and contact you to schedule an interview. 

 

How do I present my startup at a Startup Huddle? 
To present at a Startup Huddle, locate the Startup Huddle chapter in a city near you and click the “Become a Startup Huddle Presenter” button. You can also click on Apply to Present underneath the Get Involved tab on the website. The local organizer for the chapter at which you request to present will contact you to discuss next steps.  

 

How long is each Startup Huddle event? 
Startup Huddle events last for about 60 minutes if there is one (1) presenter or 90 minutes if there are two (2) presenters. Each event follows the format below: 

15 min - Networking 
2 min - Welcoming Remarks 
6 min - Entrepreneur #1 presentation 
20 min - Q+A: Community Feedback
6 min – Entrepreneur #2 presentation (optional) 
20 min – Q+A: Community Feedback (optional) 
10 min - Community Announcements 
2 min - Closing Remarks 
Remaining time - Networking 
 

What’s the best way for me to stay informed about upcoming Huddles? 
Every Startup Huddle chapter maintains a local webpage. There, you can find news and information, including upcoming presentations. Outside of that, communities can differ in regard to communication. We recommend asking your local organizer (listed on the page) how to best stay in the know. To find your local organizer, locate the Startup Huddle chapter nearest you. 

 

As an attendee, am I expected to participate in the event? 
You have the freedom to participate as much as you wish. We only ask that you arrive on time and be respectful to the presenters, attendees and organizers. 

 

Do I need startup or business experience to attend a Startup Huddle event? 
You do not. Anyone who is interested in supporting local startups is welcome. We aim to make the program as accessible and diverse as possible in order to bring new ideas and people into the startup ecosystem. 

Building startup ecosystems, one entrepreneur at a time.
Where communities connect + founders flourish.

Startup Huddle builds local startup communities while crowd-sourcing advice and support, one entrepreneur at a time. Run by the Global Entrepreneurship Network, it consists of monthly, if not weekly, gatherings of local community and business leaders, founders, ecosystem builders, investors and others interested in helping startups flourish.

In addition to providing direct support to entrepreneurs, the program addresses a critical element of success for all ecosystems – connectivity. GEN-backed research shows that startup communities with greater levels of local connectedness translate to an increased number of startups – and that founders with high levels of connectivity grow their revenue twice as fast as those with lower levels.

Held regularly on the same day and at the same time, Startup Huddle increases connectivity by convening the community to see each other while listening to and supporting local founders who give six-minute presentations outlining challenges faced by their company. Each presentation is followed by a 20-minute conversation offering constructive criticism focused on finding solutions and increasing founder know-how. With new founders cycling through each gathering, and previous presenters joining the audience to give back, the community continues to expand while connections deepen.

Currently, there are chapters in more than 80 cities around the world that support 1,500 founders annually. Each chapter is organized by a local community builder and supported by local partners. GEN connects organizers through a virtual platform to share best practices, identify rising stars and create global linkages between ecosystems.

Startup Huddle is made possible through a combination of national licensees who manage the program in their country, a network of volunteer local organizers and corporate partners.

The Global Entrepreneurship Network operates programs, like Startup Huddle, that make it easier for anyone, anywhere to start and scale a company. GEN divides its programs into four distinct categories: those that celebrate entrepreneurs and inspire others to follow in their footsteps; those intended to better understand the underlying conditions that best enable entrepreneurs to thrive; those that support entrepreneurs through proven policy and programmatic interventions; and those that connect entrepreneurs, ecosystem builders and community leaders to strengthen local ecosystems around the world.
