                <p>The Center for Entrepreneurship implemented the <a href="/programs/industries">Industry startup programs</a> since 2020. Startup Club, launched globally in 2020, is an international program dedicated to supporting entrepreneurs from communities in 18 specific industries. It fosters collaboration through bi-weekly sessions where two entrepreneurs present their businesses, receiving valuable feedback and solutions from the community. Our Industry Mentorship Programs match you with a sector expert during onboarding to help integrate you into the community. You can deeply engage with your chosen tech field, addressing unique challenges, networks, and opportunities. This initiative empowers entrepreneurs with insights, expands networks, and integrates them into the global entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>
