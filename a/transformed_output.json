G20 Young Entrepreneurs’ Alliance members are currently recruiting young entrepreneurs in their countries to participate in the G20 YES. In Russia, The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship, which represents Russia in the G20 Young Entrepreneurs’ Alliance, is finalizing Russia’s delegation of 20 high-potential young entrepreneurs to represent their country at the summit. Russian delegates will be owners of companies in various stages of development and industries. The Russian delegates will be joined at the G20 YES in Nice with over 400 entrepreneurs worldwide, aged between 18 and 45, to discuss how to best harness the potential of young entrepreneurs globally. The resulting recommendations will then be officially handed to the G20 leaders on November 3rd. The measures that summit delegates intend to propose will demonstrate how entrepreneurship can be viewed as the key to overcoming the global recession and a major ally in shaping the economy of an innovative, sustainable and united 21 st century world. This is particularly the case for young people, both in emerging countries and throughout the developed world. These measures are set to respond to the strategic questions pertaining to the mobilization of the resources necessary to strengthen entrepreneurship by underlining to what extent this particular ecosystem defines the growth, the prosperity and the competitiveness of a nation. The proposals will be formally addressed to G20 Heads of state to coincide with their own summit. They are based on two international studies, the first one being undertaken with McKinsey & Company to highlight best practices in favor of enterprise and entrepreneurship. The second one, a barometer of entrepreneurial confidence by Ernst & Young that could serve as a framework for future public evaluation, assesses the means implemented by G20 countries to support entrepreneurs. Previously held in Toronto and Seoul, France is hosting the G20 YES, with the official support of the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy - who will also chair the 2011 G20 Heads of State summit. “Young Russian entrepreneurs are excited to participate in the G20 YES. They are eager to share their experiences in growing businesses in Russia’s emerging economy, to learn from their peers representing other G20 countries, and to contribute to developing recommendations to the G20 leaders that will influence policy initiatives to promote youth entrepreneurship globally.”, states Victor Sedov, President of The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship, the G20 Young Entrepreneurs’ Alliance member that represents Russia. \"Thanks to the G20 YES, entrepreneurship has gone from strength to strength on a global scale and this constitutes the beginning of a large-scale movement . The daring innovations of the entrepreneurs, their capacity to create jobs and help small and medium enterprises to develop the flexibility required to face the challenges of today’s globalized world, combined with our capacity to finance and invest in them, represent the key to shaping a desirable 21 st century economy.\", says Grégoire Sentilhes, President of the association “Les Journées de l’Entrepreneur” , the French G20 Young Entrepreneurs’ Alliance member, which is hosting and organizing this year’s G20 YES. About the G20 Young Entrepreneurs’ Alliance (G20 YEA): The G20 Young Entrepreneurs’ Alliance (G20 YEA) is a collective of leading entrepreneurially-minded organizations representing the G20 countries who seek to promote youth entrepreneurship as a powerful driver of economic renewal, job creation, innovation and social change. The Alliance was founded as a movement to engage the G20 leaders in the cause of youth entrepreneurship, share information across borders, affect positive policy change and create a global network of young entrepreneur advocates while building a collaborative entrepreneurial environment worldwide. The G20 YEA provides leadership to G20 political leaders in best practices in promoting youth entrepreneurship through policy recommendations and sharing best practices in the areas of access to funding, coordinating support initiatives, enhancing the entrepreneurship culture, regulation and taxation, and education and training. Annually the G20 YEA organizes the G20 Young Entrepreneur Summit (G20 YES), a 3 day international summit with over 400 entrepreneurs from 18 to 45 years old attending the event from each G20 member country. Delegates work during the summit to finalize recommendations on promoting youth entrepreneurship which are forwarded to the G20 Heads of State during their summit.

Morris, Modern Russia There is a global entrepreneurial revolution afoot, and Russia is in its midst.  Free markets represent a highly effective economic structure or system, but they do not work without someone to drive them.  The driver is the entrepreneur.  There is a need for a society filled with individuals with dreams, who will take calculated risks, demonstrate tenacity and perseverance, and creatively overcome the challenges and obstacles that are inherent in creating something new. In Russia, as a generation comes of age born after the fall of communism, we ask, where will the 21st century entrepreneurs come from? As a small part of the answer, Oklahoma State University has partnered with two other universities to take a nationally-recognized entrepreneurship training program to St. Petersburg, Russia.  The Dynamic Entrepreneurship Classroom is an intense, three-day exposure to best practices in entrepreneurship education for university faculty from across the Russian Federation. Importantly, the focus is on more than new venture creation --- it is about the entrepreneurial mindset. Entrepreneurship is about transformation and empowerment. It is concerned with how to recognize opportunity, leverage resources, mitigate risks, and embrace creativity and innovation. Entrepreneurial ventures are responsible for producing more than three-quarters of the new jobs in American society, and they are the dynamic that creates most of the new products, services, processes, markets, technologies and business models. And beyond the start-up venture, the entrepreneurial mindset applies to family firms, non-profit ventures, the public sector, large corporations, and virtually any other organizational context. Entrepreneurship education has no history in Russia. Even in the United States, the emphasis on developing curricula and conducting scholarly research on entrepreneurship has only been prominent for about thirty years.  But the growth has been explosive.  Today, more than 3,000 American colleges, universities and institutes of higher learning offer some sort of entrepreneurship program.  At a number of schools, one can pursue an undergraduate major or minor or a master’s degree in entrepreneurship.  Some universities offer as many as thirty unique courses on different aspects of entrepreneurship.  And the entrepreneurship centers on American campuses are actively involved in economic development activities in their communities. Russia is playing catch up, and is catching up pretty quickly. Business schools are appearing and a number of these are top quality. New entrepreneurship courses are being launched and interesting experiments are underway in terms of creating business start-up incubators, forming networks for entrepreneurs to join, launching business plan competitions, and more. The challenge, however, is that there are very few faculties with any formal training in entrepreneurship education.  Russia currently lacks the infrastructure to support entrepreneurs, and this is where programs like the Dynamic Classroom come into play. For the fifth time over the past few years, Oklahoma State University has joined with Texas Christian University and Syracuse University to share the powerful potential of entrepreneurship with Russian faculty members. The program aims to equip faculty with the tools they need to effectively teach entrepreneurship both within universities and to Russian citizens hoping to start new ventures. These faculty members will reach tens of thousands of students and community residents through their academic programs, incubators, economic development organizations and other entities. Thirty-three Russian faculty members representing institutions throughout the far-reaching Russian Federation were recently exposed to lectures, discussions, experiential exercises and classroom demonstrations. The participants had backgrounds in engineering, economics, accounting, finance and the humanities. They were introduced to leading edge teaching methods, new perspectives on the core content of entrepreneurship, approaches for building a great entrepreneurship program, and novel approaches to experiential teaching and learning. Coordinated on the Russian side by Dr. Galina Shirokova, director of the Center for Entrepreneurship at St. Petersburg University together with the U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship , the program brings together top entrepreneurship educators from America to explore how the entrepreneurial spirit can be nurtured in the modern Russian economy . The results have been significant in terms of new courses launched in Russia as well as exciting new approaches to course design and delivery. This includes efforts both within Russian universities as well as programs targeting citizens who want to start businesses. Oklahoma State has also just completed a formal agreement with St. Petersburg University, one of the premier schools in Russia, for ongoing student and faculty exchanges. In spite of the legacy of a planned and controlled economy, it seems that Russians are naturally drawn to entrepreneurship, and opportunities abound.  What stands out from our experiences with the Dynamic Classroom is the hunger among faculty for new techniques and tools for teaching entrepreneurship, and the speed with which they adopt and improve upon these tools in their own classrooms. At Oklahoma State University and our partner colleges, we have embraced entrepreneurship as one of the most powerful tools for change and growth in the world. For us, entrepreneurship is a philosophy, a way of life. It is a means to empower people to build their own futures and the world around them.  It is people creating value, generating jobs, inventing solutions, and producing wealth. Dr. Michael H. Morris is a professor and N. Malone Mitchell Chair head at Oklahoma State University, where he is also the director of the School of Entrepreneurship at the Spears School of Business.

IDO – Vi с tor, how do things stand with the culture of technological entrepreneurship and generally the culture of entrepreneurship in Russia today? Compared with the United States, where do we lag behind the most? – To me, it would be better to talk about the culture of entrepreneurship on the whole. Of course Russia does have entrepreneurial culture but compared with many other countries, the USA and euro zone above all, it is still in an embryo stage. This could be best illustrated by figures describing the small and medium business sector contribution to Russian economy. If I am not mistaken, the figure is 21 percent of Russia’s gross national product and the number of SME-employed people is in the area of 20 percent as well of the total able-bodies population. If we are to compare these figures with the USA, France, Germany, even China, we will see that SME is a key sector there, contributing about 60 percent to the overall economy of those countries and employing just as many people, three times more than in Russia. So the Russian figures speak for themselves. We do have a culture of entrepreneurship, and we do have progress in its development, but the development itself is regretfully still very slow. Sure enough, the figures describing SME contribution to the country’s GNP are but some of the parameters of the entrepreneurial culture development level. Other factors to be taken into account include methods of corporate governance and the general level of business transparence, and so on. Hence, if we witness quite a high level of corruption in Russia, this points to the unhappy fact that entrepreneurs often try to get advantages for their businesses not by increasing the transparence of the business or improving the methods of running it but by finding the “right” official who will do something beneficial for the corporation and thus help it “develop” the business. Sadly enough, a lot of Russian entrepreneurs prefer this way of thinking and operating, disregarding other possibilities. – Can this be changed? Can the trend be reversed? And what’s the trick: a certain government policy or the Soviet mentality? – The government policy is officially targeted against corruption. But Russia has such a bureaucratic and multi-level, branched system of government officials, with rather low salaries, too, that this fact is a corruption driver in itself. The psychology of people, no doubt, plays an important role as well. How can this be changed? Strange as it may seem, I don’t think it’s a matter of repression, rather it’s a matter of education, teaching and learning which can give people positive rather than negative examples to follow. This is what can be done and must be done. One of our events was dedicated to business transparence and, more importantly, its cost to the entrepreneur. Some time ago lots of people here would talk about transparence, corporate governance in business, but no one explained how much it cost and what the benefit was. For that event, we used what seemed to us a very good and positive explaining example when we invited a Nizhny Novgorod entrepreneur to Moscow to tell the story of his company. Let me briefly describe it. He had a network of supermarkets and realized the benefit of business transparence. To make everything transparent and clear (accounting, bookkeeping, etc.) he spent around $90,000, quite an amount for a regional entrepreneur. The result was that he approached a U.S. private equity fund, then managed by Delta Capital Management, which, in turn, invested several million dollars in his company to ensure business growth. A few years later, the network and the fund exited the market successfully by selling the supermarket network to Perekrestok, a well-known network retailer. The entrepreneur himself got a profit of several million dollars. So I think this kind of an example, the comparative analysis of business transparence advantages, and the analysis of profitability of investing in transparence made a lot of people think (we arranged the event precisely for Russian entrepreneurs): Is it worth looking for that sought-after official doing “good” for the company at all, and not for free into the bargain? Obviously, the “sought-after official” way may not only lead you to the dock but also is unable as such to let small and medium businesses earn millions. We believe such positive examples, cases as it were, like the one I just described, to be very useful; we believe that printed and electronic media should write and talk about them more than they are doing. If that becomes a fact a lot of people are sure to follow the track. – What are the factors do you think that hamper Russian small and medium businesses’ deeper involvement in innovation activities like the U.S or EU countries? – Some time ago, a lot of attention was paid to this issue by Opora Rossii which made a survey discovering numerous findings. To me, however, one of the biggest problems is rooted in the drawbacks of the Russian system of higher education. For illustration purposes, let me use a U.S. example, namely MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Quite recently, the Kansas City based Kaufman Foundation, a leading institution promoting entrepreneurship globally, published their research findings suggesting that the totality of the companies set up by MIT graduates would be a No. 17 economy in the world (if counted conservatively, under a more liberal counting method they would rank 13th). This is graduates of just one educational institution, I emphasize. The conclusion made by the expert group is evident: the MIT, with the fundamental research school that it has, has built a successfully coexisting unique entrepreneurial ecosystem. They’ve got a Center for Entrepreneurship with proper laboratories. All students get training in entrepreneurship, a separate subject. They have an invention registration division. They have established an excellent relationship with the venture capital community. Here is a real operating model of an innovator or if you wish innovation institution. Now about what they have and we haven’t? Certainly, Russia has lots of excellent institutions of higher learning, some of them with a long research record. The problem is not that we don’t have technical specialists, the problem is that are not taught to know entrepreneurship, a subject that is only beginning to slowly establish in our education. In the U.S., on the contrary, entrepreneurship is taught to students majoring in all subjects, from maths and engineering to history and journalism. They are perfectly well aware that in the future this will help them look for an alternative way of self-employment, self-development, self-realization, not necessarily in a “specific” area but maybe in their own business. And the task of teaching entrepreneurship does not at all boil down to teaching students how to write a business plan. This is just a tool. The task is much more complex, namely teach the student to think “out of the box”, i. e., not in formulaic terms, look for opportunities to implement interesting ideas, take reasonable risks, be responsible, in other words develop qualities that an entrepreneur needs. Therefore, the biggest chair at the Harvard School of Business is the chair of entrepreneurship which practises a case-based method, that is, analyzing success stories of specific companies. This sort of training, using positive examples, is in my opinion very helpful in developing entrepreneurial thinking. What is always very important for the younger generation is success stories, successful people, and talking to them. That is why one obligatory element of such training is inviting successful businessmen as lecturers. We have a long way to go before we get there. In this country there lots of talented researchers and inventors. But nobody teaches them to commercialize ideas, convert them into business projects, get them to the implementation stage and, eventually, to profit. One possible factor which could reverse the situation is a proper infrastructure within educational institutions, such as business incubators and technoparks, but according to numerous independent opinions, most of the existing Russian technoparks is simply business centers letting their spaces, which very often is their only business model. By and large, there is nothing innovative about them. Also, there are apparent imbalances, at least regional: according to media, the Chechen and Karachai-Cherkes Republics have 11 technoparks while the Krasnodar Krai has only one (obviously not enough for Krasnodar). As I mentioned before, even if a region has a technopark its “content” does not always match its “form”. At our end, we are trying to help change the situation; in particular, together with Intel we are developing a training program for technopark and business incubator managers to make sure they work for real innovations, not just profit from letting out their spaces. – But it’s not everywhere like this, is it? – No, it isn’t. Luckily, there are good examples as well. For instance, the Economic Department of Moscow State University has a well-functioning Center for Entrepreneurship, which operates in close cooperation with the Innovation Studio set up with Intel support. They really develop entrepreneurship: we have attended presentations of three companies set up with their assistance and owned by former or current students of the University’s Economic Department. One of them has reached a turnover of $350,000 per month and has created 300 jobs. All the three companies are indeed innovative IT entities. Another company which originated there has now set up a branch in Virginia, and the Americans are happy to see jobs created by Russians. On the whole, I think, the Economic Department of Moscow State University is seeing the birth of the “right” educational-entrepreneurial ecosystem like the one at MIT. – What’s your perception of our technoparks in general, from the western perspective? – By definition, a technopark is a place where innovations are born. They only come to exist where there is an appropriate climate for interchange of ideas, concepts, cultures. Innovations always emerge at a junction of sciences and competencies. Therefore for every technopark, interaction of various experts is vital because an unprejudiced look, say of a biologist and chemist may solve a problem which is unresolvable for a team consisting of say physicists only. This is what innovations are about, an intersection of ideas and knowledge. – What is the role of government support in the field of innovation entrepreneurship development? – In this field, the government plays a very important role. Recently, a lot of important positive steps have been made towards the development of innovative technological entrepreneurship. One of the biggest of those steps is the creation of the Russian Venture Company (RVC). Through RVC and other similar institutions, quite considerable money is invested in the development of small and medium businesses, something that did not exist five years ago. Ironically, we partially owe this to the crisis. It was during the crisis that it became clear that the economy badly needed diversification and could not rely on the mining sector alone. The crisis pushed the government and the economy towards innovative development to resolve the existing problems. It is noteworthy that the Ministry of Economic Development on the whole and its respective department are looking at the western experience, including U.S. experience, and doing quite a good job bearing real fruit. Also the Obama-Medvedev commission is working and its small and medium business subcommission, with useful experience interchange. For example, a delegation of Russian single-industry cities recently visited Pittsburgh, a typical former single-industry place which used to focus on steelmaking only. Owing to economic diversification and SME sector development, the city did not die after the key players of the region’s industry; undoubtedly we can learn from that lesson. Again, the government has made a large number of positive steps in the area of innovation activities development; but more is yet to be done. – What do you think is the first thing to be done? – No doubt, the financial component plays a huge role. I am not talking about direct investments, rather about developing an economic environment where credit resources are available to our innovation entrepreneurs at lower credit rates, for example. But the more important thing to me is support of training. Teach, teach, and teach again. Regretfully, there is often more money (judging by the regional program experience) and affordable credits available for entrepreneurs, more than there are people applying for them. And this fact brings us back to where we started, to the issue of entrepreneurial culture in Russia. At a recent meeting of the U.S. Small Business Administration and Moscow University students, after the audience of 200 people was asked if anybody wanted to become an entrepreneur only one hand went up. In fact, in popularizing entrepreneurship and initiative an important role could be played by media, including government media: society and young people in particular badly need positive examples and success stories. – What is the role of organizations like your Center in shaping entrepreneurial culture in Russia? – Our activities can be divided into three areas. Area one is about entrepreneurship training for college, university and business school professors. For those who can be taught in English, we arrange trainings and trips in the U.S. and Europe; for those who can’t, we arrange foreign trainers’ visits in Russia. By now we have trained about 180 professors in Russia; I must admit, this is not much yet. We have a lot more work to do, but we work hard on this because we view current students as a critical foundation for the perception of ideas of entrepreneurship as such. In what concerns the development of youth entrepreneurship we cooperate with Rosmolodezh among others, offer entrepreneurship lectures at lake Seliger, act as an official organizer of the Global Entrepreneurship Week, represent Russia on the Young Entrepreneurs’ Alliance of G20, implement a mentor program together with the International Business Leaders’ Forum, support the Junior Achievement program, and a lot more. Secondly, we have numerous educational programs for entrepreneurs themselves. When a business is developing, the owner needs new knowledge: he needs to know how to work with investors, banks, venture entities, correctly write business plans for a new development stage, and so on. We do not teach this to managers, our educational modules focus particularly on business owners only, i. e., entrepreneurs themselves. After he goes through 9 modules of our Fast Track Planning SM system, an entrepreneur is capable (which is proven by practice) of writing a new business plan for a new stage of his company’s development. I would like to emphasize, these are not programs for startup companies (where in my opinion government support must play a more important role), they are for growing businesses which make the biggest contribution to the gross national product and produce the biggest economic effect. We know from U.S. experience that during the business growth stage it is vitally important for entrepreneurs to communicate with peers, exchange ideas and experience. To this end, we sponsor a large number of business meetings, conferences, round tables, and so on. It is also important to nurture “a culture of success recognition”; in this field, we support numerous entrepreneurship awards and competitions, for instance the Ernst&Young competition of Entrepreneur of the Year. Since this year we’ve had our own award, For Contribution to the Development of the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem. And finally, the third area of our activities – our own analytical and economic research studies which help organizations like Opora Rossii in lobbying changes towards a more favorable entrepreneurial climate in Russia. I want to specifically note that our contribution to the development of entrepreneurship in Russia wouldn’t be so effective without the financial and strategic support of institutions like the U.S.-Russian Foundation for Economic Advancement and the Rule of Law (USRF), Ernst & Young, Intel, and others. – Vi с tor, thank you for a most interesting interview! – Thank you. I would like to wish a merry Christmas and a happy New Year to all your readers. Hopefully, our joint effort will become a weighty, albeit small, contribution to society’s recognition of the importance of developing an entrepreneurial culture in this country.

This educational program was developed by the Kauffmann Foundation (USA) and is based on best practices of the U.S school of business. In Russia, it is implemented by the Center for Entrepreneurship in Moscow. The training in Voronezh was unique as it targeted small and socially oriented businesses. Assistance from the Our Future Foundation helped make the seminar attendance free for entrepreneurs and provide accommodation for participants from remote areas of the Voronezh Oblast. Irina Gorelova, coordinator of Youth Business of Russia in the Voronezh Oblast, who also coordinated the implementation of this educational program for the Center, gave a detailed description of the training: “The program consists of 9 modules designed to give basic knowledge in marketing, financial documentation, production, and growth management. For each module, an entrepreneur is invited who uses his business as an example in talking about the subject and shares his experience with the participants. The role of experts at that seminar was played by successful Voronezh entrepreneurs. Vladimir Lisovsky, the General Manager of the Union furniture shop, talked about how to build and motivate a good management team. Grigory Chuiko, the manager of OAO Voronezhselmash, Yuri Segal, the General Manager of OOO Prok, and Gleb Lapenkov, the head of Somovomyasoprodukt, shared their secrets of marketing management in a business. Head of the Sodruzhestvo Association of Auditors, Georgy Popov, the owner of the Lik chain of salons, Lyubov Roshchevkina, and the Executive Director of the Interlingua School of Foreign Languages, Yelena Kuznetsova, shared their experiences in keeping financial documents. Most of the speakers are heavily involved in community work and take part in the Youth Business of Russia program in the Voronezh Oblast as mentors. The facilitator of the program in Voronezh was Maxim Gvozdev, a certified FastTrac® Planning™ trainer, co-owner and General Manager of Lean4systems Group. In 2006, Maxim Gvozdev entered the FastTrac® Planning™ program with the simple purpose of writing a business plan and selling his company. The training dramatically changed his attitude towards his business: Maksim realized that in fact he was running three different businesses, where each requires attention in its own right. He changed his mind and pushed his company to a new level rather than selling it. Lean4systems Group now supports the IT infrastructure of Russian and U.S. companies, develops software, and works in the field of 3D printing. As Maxim put it himself, “Entrepreneurs are the same everywhere; if it’s a living person he will adapt himself to any conditions because he cannot but do business. The audience in Voronezh, by the way, is lively. They are real entrepreneurs and each is a success in his business”. No wonder the facilitator valued his listeners highly: the main criteria of selection for the program was the existence of a running business and its social focus. The result was a group of 23 people from the fields of manufacturing, tourism, education, and services. A majority are individual entrepreneurs, who view their business rather as a hobby or “self-employment”. However, each of them can be with good reason called a socially responsible entrepreneur. For example, some of the program participants give jobs to people released from prison, some train and hire former alcohol and drug addicts. Yevgeny Kuzmin’s company, a small business producing and selling natural lemonades, employs full-time students — a flexible time-table and a good salary help them combine work and education. Vitaly Dedov arranges colored glass master classes for adults and children. During the seminar, students followed the curriculum covering the principal aspects of company operation, for which individual entrepreneurs hardly find time or resources. Their own businesses serve as a permanent aid for student assignments. The results are discussed by groups whose membership is changed by the facilitator all the time, so that everybody can share his experience with people coming from other fields and get to know how they handle similar situations. The training should result in a business plan for company development. According to Vladimir Yatsun, the Doctor-in-Chief of OOO MIP Onkoimmunoprofilaktika, “a socially oriented entrepreneur often thinks that the idea he followed didn’t work. But in actual fact, it may be that it simply was not implemented in full and must be viewed from a different angle. If a business has reached its peak of development one has to look for a new idea and think how to translate it into life. From this perspective, the FastTrac® Planning™ program is unique. One can see that people looked at their businesses, plans and ideas in a different manner and gained knowledge of how to transform it into reality.” Judging by the program participants’ response in Voronezh, they changed their attitudes to business, to say the least. Oksana Fedosova, Organizator Children’s Sport School: “I thought it was my hobby in which I could invest. Here I realized it can be a source of revenue, too, because the idea is welcome in Voronezh.” Vitaly Dedov, Dedov’s Workshop: “I discovered aspects which I am going to use: financial planning, a view of my production facility from the perspective of value gain for the client.” Shifting focus to the client and orientating towards what he gets from dealing with the company is the change in thinking that was noted by a majority of the participants. It is essential to not keep it a theory but strive to translate it into life.

My Own Business magazine, November 2012 We are living in the age of information. Having the right knowledge, being in the know, keeping abreast with the times — that’s what makes you strong! The time of new opportunity has come for Russian entrepreneurs. And, their challenge is to rise to that opportunity. You only need to know how. Victor Sedov, President, Center for Entrepreneurship, is confident that it is possible and critical to develop entrepreneurship. What is the mission of the Center for Entrepreneurship? The Center for Entrepreneurship was set up as an initiative of the U.S. Russia Investment Fund. Our goal is to accelerate entrepreneurship in Russia. The Center acts as a catalyst organization expanding the scope of entrepreneurship in this country by combining educational and system-building programs aimed at meeting the interests of growth company leaders. Ten years ago the entrepreneurship situation in Russia was devastating. It still takes a lot of effort to develop it. However, Russia is seeing some positive changes in that arena. By 2020, Russian entrepreneurship is expected to rise to a more acceptable level. The leaders of the country have formulated ambitious tasks, which already is a good thing. The nation realizes that economic diversification is on the agenda. You can’t possibly take care of the raw materials industry. I have spent 20 years in the field of entrepreneurship development. It’s a long way to go yet, but the route is chosen correctly and the necessary steps are being made. How can one help the Russian entrepreneur? By what means? The forms and programs of support are extremely numerous now. Entrepreneurs need specific knowledge. Our Center for Entrepreneurship is different from others inasmuch as it has specially designed educational programs which include individual 4-hour modules dedicated to the most significant problems faced by companies. One program which is very popular in Russia now is the 9-module FastTrac® Planning™. Our trainers are entrepreneurs as well. It doesn’t help much to teach entrepreneurs using professors who have never owned a business or come across typical business problems. Nearly all Russian regional governments have dedicated departments for support of entrepreneurship, various guarantee funds, MSP Bank offering credit resources to commercial banks. At the initial stage of business development, a mentor’s advice is important; this is what Youth Business Russia program, now operating in six Russian regions, is about. The Federal Youth Agency, Rosmolodezh, has developed an important project, You Are an Entrepreneur, designed to increase entrepreneurship awareness among youngsters. What sort of education do entrepreneurs need nowadays? Originally, our target audience was growth entrepreneurs. Developing businesses need contacts, access to capital, equity investment. They are the quickest to introduce new jobs and contribute to the development of the country’s national wealth. Our time and capital costs invested in working with such people pay back the best. FastTrac® Planning™ was designed precisely for such entrepreneurs. It is an art running a company by means of business planning. After reading this course, an entrepreneur can write a new business plan, outline new prospects for himself, and understand how to get there. Our individual modules are useful for both newcomers on the market and for fast growth companies because they provide fundamental knowledge of marketing, strategic planning, personnel planning, and so on. We also make good use of what is called networking, i. e. communication with peers. This form of contact is very useful for a fast growing entrepreneur. Business breakfast meetings help him find the people he needs. For that purpose, we organize entrepreneurial groups in regions where we have a presence. They are locations where entrepreneurs can listen to renowned speakers from Europe and the United States. Is it worth betting on young people today? Young people are exactly what one should bet on. To ensure 50 percent employment in small and medium businesses (the figure now is only 21 percent) we need millions of new entrepreneurs. Our hopes and efforts are meant to ensure that a majority of young people dream of an entrepreneurial career. Students don’t rush to become entrepreneurs today, with only three to four percent prepared to undertake entrepreneurship. To advance entrepreneurship it must be taught at colleges and universities. Look at the Western experience: entrepreneurship is the biggest chair at Harvard today. Entrepreneurship is lectured as a course for students majoring in all subjects. Sooner or later, a student will face a situation where he has to make a decision. It is essential that young people learn to think differently. A business plan alone will not help. A young entrepreneur must be capable of taking the responsibility and reasonable risks. Yet, only some Russian educational institutions work on this. But it is universities who clearly must be abreast with the times. Russia’s future depends on society’s attitude towards the development of entrepreneurship. What was the purpose of setting up the Alliance for Entrepreneurship Development? The goal of the Alliance is to bring the accumulated experience and designed programs to Russian regions. Today, these include Ryazan, Voronezh, Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, and Chelyabinsk. We’re just at the starting line. Hopefully, all Russia will join us. No country can develop entrepreneurship without a dialog between the government, the educational system, and entrepreneurs. Without joint efforts, we will see no positive results. In a year from now, we shall be summing up the first results. In March, a global entrepreneurial congress will take place in Brazil; in June the G20 Young Entrepreneurs’ Alliance Summit will be held, with young and successful entrepreneurs from 19 foreign countries and Russia attending. The year 2013 is the year of Russia as a host country. We will suggest that our partners within the Alliance send their entrepreneurs to that summit. The Center for Entrepreneurship hosts the Global Entrepreneurship Week (GEW) in Russia. This ambitious project unites 129 countries and is aimed at developing entrepreneurship globally and entrepreneurial culture, including that in Russia. What prospects of entrepreneurship development do you think await Russia the next ten years? Russia has a huge potential, but compared to the Western world everything is in embryo state here. However, a number of industries show loads of opportunities with room for the development of entrepreneurial initiative. It only takes to pitch in, believing in yourself and without fear. Tens of thousands of people can become entrepreneurs and make weighty contributions to the national economy. What would you wish for the entrepreneurs of the Rostov Oblast? It is very important for them to realize how useful it is to talk to their peers. One shouldn’t try to fight alone. Knowledge is critical. The world is changing so fast that one has to know what’s going on. At the end of the day, this will be your competitive edge.

The route is chosen correctly and the necessary steps are being made.</p><h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Educational Programs and Networking Opportunities</h3><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>Our forms and programs of support are extremely numerous now. Entrepreneurs need specific knowledge. Our Center for Entrepreneurship is different from others inasmuch as it has specially designed educational programs which include individual 4-hour modules dedicated to the most significant problems faced by companies. One program which is very popular now is the 9-module <a href='/programs/fasttrac'>Fasttrac</a>. Our trainers are entrepreneurs as well. It doesn't help much to teach entrepreneurs using professors who have never owned a business or come across typical business problems. Nearly all regional governments have dedicated departments for support of entrepreneurship, various guarantee funds, MSP Bank offering credit resources to commercial banks. At the initial stage of business development, a mentor’s advice is important; this is what the Youth Business program is about. The Federal Youth Agency has developed an important project, You Are an Entrepreneur, which is designed to increase entrepreneurship awareness among youngsters. <a href='/programs/global-entrepreneurship-week'>Global Entrepreneurship Week</a> is one of our most ambitious projects. It unites 129 countries and aims at developing entrepreneurship globally and fostering an entrepreneurial culture. Our individual modules provide fundamental knowledge for both newcomers and fast growth companies. Networking, i.e., communication with peers, is also crucial for a growing entrepreneur. Business breakfast meetings help entrepreneurs find the people they need. For that purpose, we organize entrepreneurial groups in regions where we have a presence. They are locations where entrepreneurs can listen to renowned speakers from Europe and the United States.</p></div></div></section></div></div>"

Evgeny Levkin, Head of the new Alliance, in his interview to the Svoe Delo Media magazine: “Our Alliance is another step to improve the entrepreneurial culture in Russia.” Alliance Strategy The Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE) came up with an idea of setting up an association of entrepreneurship organizations in early 2012. The reason for that was a constantly increasing number of CFE’s partners in Russian regions wanting access to advanced entrepreneurship development programs in their regions. The strategy of the Alliance is to create a favorable environment - an ecosystem - for developing entrepreneurship in Russian regions. The Alliance’s activities are focused on providing Russian entrepreneurs access to international and national entrepreneurship events, educational programs, and initiatives that promote entrepreneurship as the foundation of economic well-being, and that create a favorable environment for innovation. Join the Alliance The Alliance is open to various kinds of entrepreneurship organizations from any Russian region. The Alliance is neither a lobbyist organization nor an association of entrepreneurs. To qualify as an Alliance for Entrepreneurship Development partner, a legal entity must be an entrepreneurship organization whose main goal is the development of entrepreneurship, and that has the resources and expertise necessary to hold entrepreneurial events and train entrepreneurs and faculty. An organization should sign an agreement with the Center for Entrepreneurship to join the Alliance. New Opportunities After joining the Alliance, a partner may, for example, take part in the 2013 Global Entrepreneurship Congress in Rio de Janeiro on March 18-23, or recruit regional entrepreneur delegates to the 2013 G20 Young Entrepreneurs’ Alliance Summit in Moscow on June 15-17, or nominate entrepreneurs in their regions to participate in the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Awards. Alliance partners get access to participation in several annual events (conferences, seminars, trainings) of the Center for Entrepreneurship. Alliance partners get assistance in planning and hosting Global Entrepreneurship Week in their region, and have access to sponsorship and co-funding for entrepreneurship development programs in their regions. First Results Since the launch of the Alliance, we observed quite good progress. In October 2012, the Alliance supported the Fashion & Home Startups Forum organized by Startup Women, Alliance partner, and an organization assisting active women entrepreneurs. On November 22, it supported the Svoe Delo (Own Business) 2.0 Russian Forum of Young Entrepreneurship Leaders in Rostov-on-Don. In December 2012, the Alliance in cooperation with its partner in Kazan, Pulsar Venture, held an advanced training course in Technology Commercialization Basics for Innovation Entrepreneurs. Alliance Geography As of the beginning of 2013, Alliance partners activities are pursued in 12 Russian regions: Kaliningrad, Rostov, Ryazan, Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk and Voronezh oblasts, Republic of Tatarstan, Stavropol, Krasnodar and Primorsky krays, North Ossetia-Alania and Moscow. In each region, the activities are organized in a different manner, depending on the local opportunities and specifics. Few regions have already conducted joint activities with the Center where as others are still at the planning stage. Alliance expansion The Alliance is following the plan which we jointly designed on the basis of the partners’ wish list and capacity of the Center for Entrepreneurship. We are planning to bring at least 20 active Alliance partner regions on board by the middle of 2014. Education is Important The Center for Entrepreneurship helps entrepreneurs develop practical skills to start and grow their businesses. Russia desperately needs an educational infrastructure capable of offering contemporary entrepreneurship education programs with entrepreneurs training other entrepreneurs and universities developing entrepreneurship education programs to teach the next generation of entrepreneurs. Alliance Bulletin The Alliance for Entrepreneurship Development will be publishing Alliance quarterly newsletter. Below is the first issue covering last quarter of 2012. September 27, 2012 at the Annual Conference “Developing Entrepreneurial Companies” , organized and held as part of the 10th anniversary of the Center for Entrepreneurship, leaders of Russian regional entrepreneurship development organizations signed a Partnership Agreement with the Center for Entrepreneurship to unite efforts in entrepreneurship development by creating the Alliance for Entrepreneurship Development. The Alliance activities focus on providing Russian entrepreneurs access to international and national entrepreneurship events, educational programs, and initiatives that promote entrepreneurship as the foundation of economic well-being, and that create a favorable environment for innovation. The Alliance also promotes entrepreneurship education methodology by promoting entrepreneurship programs in universities and conducting trainings for faculty. To qualify as an Alliance for Entrepreneurship Development partner, an entity must be an entrepreneurship organization whose main goal is the development of entrepreneurship, and which has the resources and expertise necessary to hold entrepreneurial events and train entrepreneurs and faculty. On October 24, the Center for Entrepreneurship supported Fashion & Home Startups Forum organized by Startup Women, a partner of the Alliance for Entrepreneurship Development. The Forum shared trends and prospects of the fashion industry and discussed the importance of start-up developments in fashion. Startup Women is a project for active women entrepreneurs as well as all those who are interested in developing Internet start-ups in the food/fashion/kids/beauty/education area where women are the target audience and the most active customers. The forum became a successful initiative combining projects, home and fashion start-up projects, designers, mentors and investors. The Forum participants included successful entrepreneurs and beginners working on fashion and decoration projects, investors looking at fashion industry projects as good investment opportunities, fashion brand representatives and fashion bloggers, and all those interested in this industry and the ongoing trends.

The event participants discussed issues related to funding of a start-up company, innovation implementation, and generation of entrepreneurial knowledge among youngsters.

The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship represents Russia on the G20 YEA. The Alliance’s work in Korea built on its successful launch at the G20 Young Entrepreneurs Summit in Toronto, Canada in June 2010. Members signed the charter and committed to an ongoing process of engagement with the G20 movement (a copy of the charter follows). Through its role as the forum for championing the cause of G20 emerging entrepreneurs, Alliance members will also share experiences, initiatives and policies going forward in building entrepreneurial economies and fostering entrepreneurship in G20 nations and worldwide. \"We, Young Entrepreneurs' Society of Korea (YES Korea), are so pleased to be the host of G20 Young Entrepreneurs Summit, Seoul, Korea.” said Michael Lee, CEO of the organization. “All representatives discussed strategies for making the G20 YEA an even more impactful and sustainable global movement.\" The Alliance will meet prior to each G20 leaders’ summit.

Entrepreneurs turned out to be the happiest Americans as perceived by themselves. Victor Sedov , Executive Director of The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship, shares his view on the entrepreneurial phenomenon in Russia. Mr. Sedov, does it take to be born an entrepreneur or is it a matter of development? Difficult to say. Some studies result in quite specific findings suggesting that students who read entrepreneurship, among other things, start up a business of their own much more frequently than those without entrepreneurship training. This is an expected result, suggesting that entrepreneurship can and must be taught, the sooner the better, exactly like in any other field. Learning foreign languages, for example, is much easier in childhood. The same is true of mastering skills. Of course, one can be naturally predisposed to entrepreneurship in the same way as to any other activity. The younger generation now has a very good entrepreneurial potential. They don’t have the legacy of the Soviet past which threatened entrepreneurs with criminal prosecution. They are strong, enthusiastic and confident of success. Studies indicate that the desire to start up a business declines dramatically among people older than 25 years of age because they are much more prudent in weighing all the risks of enterprise, they are more skeptical as they realize the complexity of running a business of their own. President Medvedev recently announced that the number of those employed in Russian small businesses should be raised to 70 percent by 2020, whereas it is 10 percent now. In my view, we shall be able to arrive at that figure only if we take the issue of entrepreneurship education seriously and show the younger generation instruments to help them meet their entrepreneurial ambitions. But what do you think is Russia’s main obstacle to starting a business of one’s own: lack of startup capital, administrative barriers, or insufficient information? Serious administrative barriers do exist despite certain measures to reduce them that the government has been undertaking recently. However, the information field is quite broad in these issues. Also, there are opportunities to raise financial resources. So, I would say that it’s a matter of psychology. Is it true that a lot of beginning entrepreneurs avoid credits and prefer borrowing from family members or friends because the Russian mentality prevents them from living on borrowings? Business development using borrowings is a typical and quite usual thing, both in Western countries and in Russia. “Family” money is absolutely sufficient to successfully run a small family business, like a small shop. But when it comes down to business development one has to raise a different scale of funding. The difference is that borrowings are cheap in the West while the credit rates in Russia are very high. Moscow offers beginning entrepreneurs up to 350,000 rubles support grants, on a competition basis subject to certain conditions. Do you think it is much or little? It depends on what and where your business is. For Moscow it may be little, but somewhere in the province it may be enough. It’s not so much a matter of lack of funding, but rather lack of quality projects and original ideas. Last August, A. Sharov (head of Small and Medium Business Support Department, Ministry of Economic Development - editor’s comment ) said that funds for small business support have been allocated, they are available but there are very few people who are eligible for those funds. There are no interesting business ides, so the funds are very likely to stay unexpended. I’m afraid I can’t agree with you. The Internet is full of stories by people who failed to get through the administrative procedures and get grants. I am not saying getting these funds is as easy as it may seem to someone. I also admit that occasionally some things are simply not properly designed administratively. Just one example that everyone is talking about and I have personally faced: re-registration of limited liability companies. The re-registration mess, which arose for lack of distinct explanations from the Federal Tax Authority and poorly engineered procedure, was quite broadly covered in the press. Mr. Sedov, for several years you have been on the jury panel of the Entrepreneur of the Year international competition. This year you chaired the panel, so you are in a position to judge how much Russian entrepreneurs are competitive on the global market? Over the years of the competition, we have seen a rising number of Russian participants and a rising share of small business participants. Last year, for example, there was a separate nomination established for family business. As regards international competitiveness, I must say that the finalists of the national stage include very impressive nominees; suffice it to mention the winners of previous years, like Ruben Vardanyan, President of the Troika Dialog Group, Sergei Vykhodtsev, President of VELLE, and others to realize that people like them are competitive at any level. How important is the “human factor” in determining the winner? Entrepreneur of the Year winners are determined by a national jury composed of previous years’ finalists of the competition, independent experts, prominent businesspeople. I must emphasize, Ernst & Young themselves do not sit on the panel. The criteria of winner selection include both quantitative factors like the growth rate of the company’s turnover, profit and number of jobs, and qualitative aspects like the degree of innovation in the business practices, the development of original products, creative marketing and sale solutions, the scale of national and international presence, implementation of personnel development programs. The winner is selected against a combination of all these factors. The US-Russia Center for Entrepreneurship initiated the setup of the Russian Association of Entrepreneurship Education. What is the purpose of the Association? The Russian Association of Entrepreneurship Education was established in 2008. It is expected to make the best western and Russian experience available to all those who want it. The United States Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship (USASBE), which has been successful in the USA for 52 now, was taken as an example to follow. Geraldine Franklin, President of USASBE and Dean of the Business College at South Florida University, made a special trip to Moscow to tell her counterparts about the USASBE setup. Under the operation model of the Russian Association of Entrepreneurship Education, leading university professors from Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian regions take a course of training abroad to be able to teach entrepreneurship in Russia later. This creates a strong chain: professor training - student training - setup of small businesses by former students. We have seen the first results. For instance, the Economic Department of Moscow State University has set up a Center of Entrepreneurship, and an entrepreneurship training course has been designed in St. Petersburg on the basis of Russian business cases. It is a very important step because a review of US business cases in the Russian environment is not always possible or reasonable, while the above course analyses, among other things, the experience of “the Russian McDonald's”, the ChainayaLozhka chain in St. Petersburg, a leader on the local restaurant and fast food market. Following this model, the Russian Association of Entrepreneurship Education will be able to identify the best Russian curricula and set up higher-level entrepreneurship education standards on that basis. The Russian Association of Entrepreneurship Education includes about 70 members now. And yet, what is it that determines a successful business? Professional qualities alone or luck, a happy chance? To be able to use a chance one has to be prepared for it. Take Oleg Tinkov for example. He launched his credit card project much later than others and seemed hopelessly behind everybody else. But this is precisely what helped him and his project a success. It is a combination of business intuition and an understanding of what the market needs at this specific moment in time. Entrepreneurial skills are like a sail that must be driven by wind - circumstances, chance, luck. But the boat is not going anywhere without the sail. What would you wish for the readers of OporaKredit ? My impression is that in covering entrepreneurship the media tend to focus on negative facts associated with small businesses, like tax dodging for example, rather than quote success stories. From that perspective, I like the Entrepreneur of the Year awards because it inspires and sets a positive example to everyone. This is why I see the OporaKredit project as very useful: it provides important practical information for those involved in small business activities or planning to do so. I wish for OporaKredit readers to be persistent in striving towards their goals and being successful! The international competition, Entrepreneur of the Year, supported by Ernst & Young, has been held in 50 countries of the world for over 20 years . Russia has held the national stage of the competition since 2003 . On November 26, 2009, the Entrepreneur of 2009 award ceremony took place in Moscow ; the winner was Oleg Khusaenov, General Manager of Atlant-M, a holding company .

This organization was created in 2002 by the U.S. Russia Investment Fund. The Center’s founder is Patricia Cloherty, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Delta Private Equity Partners. On March 17, 2008, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin signed a decree awarding the Order of Friendship to Patricia M. Cloherty for her major contribution to the development of Russian business and for strengthening friendship and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the United States of America. The Center for Entrepreneurship has offices in Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, and St. Petersburg. It serves as a model for setting up entrepreneurship centers in the countries of Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East. In its short history, the Center already has succeeded in achieving splendid results, becoming a leader in its field, and putting into practice a highly effective means of support for entrepreneurs, one that serves as a powerful catalyst for the advancement of Russia’s entrepreneurial culture and the development of Russian business. On the occasion of its anniversary, the Center received congratulations from its partners and guests, including leading Russian businessmen, representatives of the business community and public organizations, academic institutions, and the media. Andrey Korkunov, vice president of the all-Russian organization of small and medium-sized businesses OPORA Rossii, offered words of gratitude on the organization’s behalf: “In the period of its existence, the Center has had a substantial influence on the course of political and economic development in Russia. Today, it is completely evident that when it comes to creating a favorable business climate and developing international relationships that can increase the attractiveness of the Russian economy to investors, the Center for Entrepreneurship is one of the most influential players. My words are confirmed by the indisputable reputation of the Center in the business community. For this, enormous credit is due to Victor Sedov, the Center’s Executive Director. It was he who succeeded in developing effective work on spreading ideas of entrepreneurship and on supporting programs and projects for the development of small and medium-sized businesses in Russia. There is no doubt that this course is the right one. With particular satisfaction, I note the high level of partner relations between the Center for Entrepreneurship and OPORA Rossii, which are based on trust. We act jointly in a number of areas that are of the utmost importance for the Russian economy, the chief of which is widespread efforts to get our fellow citizens involved in entrepreneurial activity and to teach them to create and develop businesses of their own.” Since the time of its creation, the Center has sought to develop an environment for networking and obtaining specialized knowledge that Russian entrepreneurs lack. Therefore, any educational program offered by the Center implies, above all, encounters of entrepreneurs with others of their kind. Anyone who wishes can attend the meetings of the Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Nizhny Novgorod Entrepreneur Groups, which the Center holds once each quarter. Opportunities for learning are provided in the form of a business breakfast, which generally packs the entire hall. The participants are attracted by the relevance of the topics and the chance to discuss them with major players in the Russian business community. Of course, not all entrepreneurs are prepared for open communication. Each one determines individually the degree of openness that is permissible for him/herself. For entrepreneurs who would like to systematize the knowledge they amass in one area or another, the Center offers educational programs based on the best international methods, presented by experts from leading American universities. Throughout America, tens of thousands of entrepreneurs have learned about business through the FastTrac™ program. This is a kind of mini-MBA course that enables students in a fairly short time to hone the skills needed to plan a business. The Center, together with Intel, launched FastTrac in Russia. All the instructors in this program have practical experience as businessmen and have been through a five-day training course given by American professionals. For three years now, the Center has sent, through its partners, professors from leading Russian universities to Harvard Business School. These participants all are interested in teaching entrepreneurship as an academic subject. Twice the Center has provided such instruction in Russia. According to evaluations by the Center for Entrepreneurship, the number of teachers who teach entrepreneurship courses for students and practicing businessmen in our country has reached a critical mass that makes it necessary to create a networking environment for these professionals as well. The Center initiated the creation of a Russian Association of Entrepreneurship Education. This association will be located at the Higher School of Management at St. Petersburg State University. Its purpose is to ensure all university and college teachers access to advanced knowledge about entrepreneurship and to give them an opportunity to network with colleagues from analogous associations in the United States and Europe. The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship has become one of the leading entities that advance the development of entrepreneurship in Russia. Every day more and more entrepreneurs begin to understand the value of networking with colleagues and learning from their experience. In the past four years, more than 11,000 entrepreneurs, politicians, and other professionals connected in one way or another to private business have taken part in the events organized and supported by the Center. The Center has helped Russian entrepreneurs establish ties with colleagues from other countries. Much still remains to be done to create conditions that would enable all Russian citizens to take advantage of economic opportunities. Nonetheless, the successful work of the Center over the course of the past five years instills confidence that entrepreneurship in Russia will flourish as before.

YEO and CFE are working together to further entrepreneurship in Russia by introducing Russian entrepreneurs to the extensive networking and knowledge resources of YEO. To introduce Russian entrepreneurs to the powerful benefits of YEO, CFE recruited four Russian entrepreneurs to be local YEO charter members and accompanied them to YEOs European Conference in Paris, France in November 2002. These charter members are now working with CFE to bring in new members and to establish the first-ever YEO Moscow Chapter, which officially launches on February 6, 2003, with a special ceremony. Plans are also underway to form a St. Petersburg Chapter, and to hold YEOs European Conference in Moscow in September 2003. I believe this new strategic partnership with The US Russia Center for Entrepreneurship will prove valuable as YEO grows and expands its global outreach into Eastern Europe, explains 2003 YEO President Sean Magennis, an entrepreneur from Dallas, Texas. It also provides a place for Russian entrepreneurs to find the peer-to-peer advice and support they seek not only locally, but also worldwide with YEOs nearly 5,000 members. Under this partnership, CFE has pledged sponsorship, administrative, recruiting and logistical assistance to YEO and its Russian chapters to ensure YEOs success in Russia . . By helping YEO expand into Russia, CFE is fulfilling its mission to accelerate entrepreneurship in Russia by providing unique educational, networking and exchange opportunities targeted specifically to Russian entrepreneurs leading growth companies. CFE is enthusiastic about our new partnership with YEO, states Victor Sedov, Director of The US Russia Center for Entrepreneurship. By giving Russian entrepreneurs access to YEOs network of successful entrepreneurs, we are exposing them to worldwide best business practices, introducing them to potential international partners, and in turn, helping to raise the prominence of entrepreneurship in Russia as a force for economic development, wealth creation and job generation. The Young Entrepreneurs Organization is the premier, peer-to-peer, global community, network and resource for entrepreneurs. Since 1987, this international nonprofit educational organization has helped its members build upon their successes through an array of learning and networking opportunities. With members in more than 142 cities, spanning 35 countries, YEOs rapidly expanding membership includes entrepreneurs from every size and type of business. YEO membership has increased by some 20 percent last year, and now is nearly 5,000 members strong. Membership in YEO is by invitation only, and is subject to approval by both YEO International and the sponsoring local chapter. Prospective YEO members must be under 40 years of age and be a founder, co-founder, owner or controlling shareholder of a business with gross annual revenues exceeding (US) $1 million. Members graduate from YEO in the year they turn 40, and are encouraged to then join World Entrepreneurs Organization. www.yeo.org The US Russia Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE) is the leading provider of education and network learning activities targeting the needs of growth entrepreneurs in Russia. CFE serves Russian entrepreneurs to assist them in developing their companies, while facilitating the entrepreneurial process in Russia. CFE promotes entrepreneurship as a positive force for economic vitality and social advancement by bringing together entrepreneurs with policymakers and investors in a learning environment that supports and advances the role and scope of entrepreneurship in Russia. CFE is an initiative of The U.S. Russia Investment Fund, a leading private equity fund in Russia, and managed in cooperation with the Foundation for Enterprise Development, a foremost educational organization dedicated to building high performing entrepreneurial organizations. www.cfe.ru Contact: Karen Seidman, YEO, VP, Communications & Marketing, kseidman@yeo.org , (703) 519-6700 x129 Matt Mladenka, YEO Strategic Alliance/Press Manager, mmladenka@yeo.org , (972) 650-4115 Eric Hansen, CFE, Program Manager, ehansen@cfe.ru , 7 (095) 252-7927 Melinda Maas-Gaffney, Beyster Institute, PR Manager, maasgaffneym@beysterinstitute.org , (858) 826-1690 back My Business Magazine Media Partner OPORA Russia Copyright © 2002, The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship Design — Creative Marketing Group , Agency of Internet Technologies ltd Development — Agency of Internet Technologies ltd",

        "parsed_text": "The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship \n\n- News russian version News Friday, February 28, 2003, 5:18 pm  New opportunity opens for entrepreneurs under 40 The Young Entrepreneurs Organization has come to Moscow, offering peer-to-peer advice, business information services and links to fellow entrepreneurs worldwide.  But only a select few under-40s can apply to join. Young Russian businesspeople are set to receive worldwide support after the opening of an office in Moscow by the Young Entrepreneurs Organization (YEO). The YEO, which helps business owners under the age of 40 worldwide, will run its Moscow chapter through a partnership with the U.S.-Russia Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE). The CFE was formed by the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund, a leading private equity fund in Russia, and is managed in cooperation with the Foundation for Enterprise Development, an educational organization dedicated to building high-performing entrepreneurial organizations. \"I believe this new strategic partnership with the CFE will prove valuable as the YEO grows and expands its global outreach into the former East European bloc, beginning from Moscow, the YEOs first chapter in the region,\" said YEO President Sean Magennis. \"Itll also provide a place for Russian entrepreneurs to find the peer-to-peer advice and support they seek  not only locally, but also worldwide among the YEOs 5,000 members in more than 142 cities spread over 35 countries.\" Member companies control more than $51 billion in combined revenues and employ nearly 500,000 people, he added. Magennis told The Russia Journal in an interview that the YEO has always been enthusiastic about coming to Russia, but that the communist system made it impossible for Western entrepreneurs to establish contact. And, after the break up of the U.S.S.R., time was needed to seek out appropriate partners. \"It took us time to plan and search for the right people in the Moscow business community to open a chapter in Moscow. But now, that we are here, we plan to spend several hundreds of thousands dollars over the next five years to support our youngest chapter,\" he said. \"In return, we expect to get new members, fresh business ideas and new market for YEO members and their products.\" However, membership in the YEO, which is only by invitation, is subject to approval by both the YEO International and the sponsoring local chapter, Magennis said. \"To qualify, a prospective YEO member must be under 40 years of age and be a founder, co-founder, owner or controlling shareholder of a business with gross annual revenues exceeding $1 million,\" he added. Members graduate from the YEO in the year they turn 40 and are encouraged to then join the World Entrepreneurs Organization. Magennis said the YEOs members pay annual dues of $800, which gives them access to the organizations versatile business-information resources and other facilities to run their businesses more effectively. \"Special programs, including those where experts are invited to address the audience, may attract extra fees, but these and other issues are exclusive prerogatives of local chapters,\" he added. The CFEs director, Viktor Sedov, was equally upbeat about the program. \"We are enthusiastic about our new partnership with the YEO, because by giving Russian entrepreneurs access to the YEOs network of successful entrepreneurs, we are exposing them to worldwide best-business practices and potential international partners,\" he said. \"And, this, in turn, will help to raise the prominence of entrepreneurship in Russia as a force for economic development, wealth creation and job generation,\" he said. Sedov also noted that plans were underway to form a St. Petersburg chapter and to hold YEOs European Conference in Moscow later in September. Sergei Vasilyev, chairman of the Federation Councils Committee for Finance and Budget Planning, said it was a great idea to open a YEO chapter in Moscow. \"It will create a forum for an exchange of business ideas. And, specifically, it will allow the YEOs members worldwide to come and learn from Russian entrepreneurs unique secrets and experience of running businesses effectively in financial conditions similar to those in war-zone areas,\" he added. Daniel Wild, the president of the YEO in Germany, which was founded in 2000 with only 20 members, and the CEO of Getmobile in Munich, said he came to support the organizations new chapter in Moscow. \"We are all here to support the Moscow chapter because Russia is a European country with a lot of opportunities, and networking among the YEOs members will allow us to develop a better business relationship with the country,\" he said.

Heads of each delegation, Victor Sedov, Executive Director of the Center for Entrepreneurship (US citizen) and Sergei Borisov, President of OPORA Russia, signed a document saying that the organizations are uniting their efforts to support entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation.  As was clear from their brief statements, they intend to encourage international cooperation with Russian entrepreneurs, in turn, raising Russias business and investment attractiveness in the international business community.  The partnership agreement outlines steps to achieve this goal through cooperative informational and consultancy services.  For instance, the parties intend to exchange information about the goods and services markets of each country.  OPORA Russia also will identify reputable entrepreneurs for exchange visits between the two countries, to be sponsored by The US Center for Entrepreneurship. Both organizations will hold joint seminars, conferences, presentations, round tables and exhibitions, and help each other in marketing each others programs.  Also, special training courses covering best business practices of each country will be organized to help learn about the market of both countries.  The US Russia Center for Entrepreneurship has offered to developed a curriculum for one-year entrepreneurial training in marketing, raising capital, corporate governance, personnel management, and financial transparency.  In its turn, OPORA Russia undertakes to provide assistance of its regional branches in holding The US-Russia Center for Entrepreneurships events at their sites. There are more substantial plans as well.  In an exclusive interview with Business for Everyone , Victor Sedov, Executive Director of The US Russia Center for Entrepreneurship, said that this agreement with OPORA compliments the Centers work to introduce the Young Entrepreneurs Organization (YEO) into Russia.  YEO is headquartered in the USA with members in 142 cities around the world.  Their entry into Russia will facilitate a direct dialog between entrepreneurs from 35 countries.  YEO already has a positive vision of Russia.  And, they are going to hold their European Conference in Moscow in September 2003, with around 200 entrepreneurs expected to attend to start business relationships in Russia. This is not just formal signing of a friendly agreement, commented Sergei Borisov.  The Center has concrete plans to help promote progressive entrepreneurship and has a mission to assist in the development of growth enterprises.  The agreement proposes a joint study into violations and protection of entrepreneurs rights in Russia, resulting in a report to be submitted to the Russian Presidential Human Rights Commission.  It is noteworthy that the Center approached OPORA Russia with a proposal for cooperation.  The reason is that we represent an organization uniting real entrepreneurs.  We were approached because our organization is becoming prominent abroad, not only in Russia.  We have also been sought out by France, China, Slovakia, and Switzerland.  The international community is looking to us because OPORA Russia is a door opening, with hopes for effective business support on the other side.  Opening it, entrepreneurs find themselves not amongst bureaucrats, but with fellow entrepreneurs.

Six Russian entrepreneurs from fast-growing companies will be matched with U.S.- based business leaders from similar industries. The goal of the Entrepreneurs Exchange is to immerse Russian entrepreneurs in the American entrepreneurial culture, and expose their American hosts to the business culture of Russia. Its a way to build relationships between entrepreneurs within a shared industry sector as a foundation for future business opportunities or trade, said Ray Smilor, president of the Foundation for Enterprise Development. By sharing ideas and strategies, participants can learn from each other and build better, higher performing organizations. The program will bring together industry leaders from varied backgrounds, including food, public relations, finance, television production, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals and provide them with an intensive hands-on experience in their respective fields. U.S. participants will include Ashley Postlewaite, CEO of Renegade Animation, Inc., a television production company that provides animation for some of the top T.V. shows and commercials; Christopher Rosica, CEO of Rosica Mulhern, Inc., a strategic PR firm based in New York; Joe Polo, CEO of Original Juan, a food production company located in Kansas City, Kansas; Jonathan Slater, CEO of Sequel Management, a venture finance firm in Boston, Massachusetts; James Weldon, CEO of MaxDisplays.com, a manufacturer of flat screen monitors and panels, located in San Jose, California; and  Monique Muri, CEO of Ram Scientific Corp., a medical products company based in Boston, Massachusetts. Russian firms participating include Studio Alisa, a television production company,  CMG, a marketing consulting company,  FIS, a food industry equipment company,  Consoil, a venture finance company, Syscom, an electronic manufacturing company, and Bioform, a medical products company. It became apparent that there was a need for a forum which would allow entrepreneurs to talk to, share ideas with, and get advice from other entrepreneurs across borders, said Victor Sedov, Executive Director of CFE. The most important thing is a collaborative learning process where people are learning from each other. Participants are chosen through a competitive application process and then selected by a joint committee of FED and CFE. The Russian entrepreneurs arrive in Washington, D.C. on May 29 to meet the U.S. participants and then will spend the next nine days with their U.S. host companies located in Boston, New York, Kansas City, Burbank and San Jose. The Foundation for Enterprise Development is a non-profit education, training and consulting organization that advances entrepreneurship worldwide. CFE, located in Moscow, is a catalyst organization, funded by the U.S. Russia Investment Fund and managed by the FED, that advances entrepreneurship in Russia through a combination of education and networking activities. YEO is the premier, peer-to-peer, global community, network and resource for entrepreneurs under age 40.

The objective of the competition is to support entrepreneurial initiative in Russia. According to Dmitry Agarunov, the publisher of My Business magazine, the contest has a dual purpose: First, to generalize the experience of companies that have achieved significant success in their growth. And second, to reveal what enabled these companies to make their breakthrough and achieve outstanding results. This experience is truly invaluable, since Russias business sector is comparatively new and is very much in need of positive examples. To enter the contest, companies must submit an application including the participants registration form and a letter telling about his or her business. The deadline for submission of entries is November 1, 2003 (the participants registration form can be filled out online at www.mybiz.ru ). Entries in the Business Breakthrough contest will be evaluated by a council of experts including prominent businessmen, economists, lawyers, and specialists in management consulting. To qualify for consideration, projects must have been implemented in the Russian market before June 1, 2003 (statistical data on the business may be based on results for 2002). The organizing committee for the contest will select five companies that have demonstrated rapid growth based on effective use of various management tools, including marketing, investment, innovation, finance, and others. The first prize is a two-week internship in a leading U.S. company. Right now were not able to give the details and finer points of the internship program for the winner of the Business Breakthrough contest. After all, we dont know exactly who will win the contest, or exactly what type of business he or she will represent, says Victor Sedov, Executive Director of The U.S.-Russia Center for Entrepreneurship. But I can say with total certainty that we will choose a U.S. company that matches the winners needs and interests as closely as possible. Our American partner--the Young Entrepreneurs' Organization , or YEO--has more than 3000 members in the United States, and each of them owns his or her own business. We can even set up a selection process in order to find a partner that exactly fits the interests of the winning company. Naturally, we will cover all the expenses of the stay in the United States. In addition, owners of firms who are under the age of 40 and whose business turnover is more than US$1 million have an opportunity to receive an invitation to join YEO.

Now Russian entrepreneurs as well have gained an opportunity to participate in this competition, and this step indicates that business in this country has acquired a deserving reputation in the international arena. The firm of Ernst & Young established the award program for the best entrepreneur in 1986, thus recognizing the growing role of private business as a driver of the global economy and a force that changes our lives for the better. Today the Ernst & Young World Entrepreneur of the Year award program is considered the most prestigious international competition in the field of entrepreneurship, while the award itself ranks as the business worlds equivalent of a Nobel Prize. Seventeen years ago, only businessmen from a few of the United States took part in the first competition. Today the program includes thirty-five countries around the world. The finalists in national competitions vie for the top prize, the Ernst & Young World Entrepreneur of the Year Award, which will be presented in Monte Carlo in May 2004. This year Russia and China joined the contenders for the first time. In both those countries, the holding of the award program is accompanied by heightened attention to the role of business, particularly in connection with future membership in the WTO. Alexander Ivlev, a partner in the firm of Ernst & Young, \"Entrepreneurship in Russia already has some history behind it--today there are many private companies in Russia that have been in operation for more than 10 years and are successfully giving concrete form to their ideas and strategies of business development. That has made it possible for us to hold a full-scale Entrepreneur of the Year competition in Russia in conformity with the international standards of Ernst & Young.\" Gregory Ericksen, a managing director of Ernst & Young, runs the international competition. Support for it is provided by entities such as CNN, CNBC, NASDAQ International, and USA Today. In the various countries involved, the competitions sponsors include the biggest companies and banks: Citigroup, SAP AG, Dell Computer, Société Générale, Deutsche Bank, and others. Equally prestigious is the international panel of judges, selected from well-known entrepreneurs and heads of large companies in various countries throughout the world. For example, in 2001 and 2002 the judges panel for the international competition was headed by John Wall, President of NASDAQ International. It is significant that many winners of past competitions have become international business leaders. They include Jeff Bezos ( Amazon.com ), Michael Dell (Dell Computer Corp.), Pierre Omidyar (eBay Inc.), Howard Schultz (Starbucks Corp.), Scott McNealy (Sun Microsystems), Larissa Herda (Time Warner Telecom), and others. Many of them received the award long before the names of their companies became household words. Today, according to Ernst & Young experts, the average capitalization of the winning company is $22 billion. The NASDAQ Stock Markets list of 100 leaders includes the names of 53 winners of the Entrepreneur of the Year Award. The winner for 2002 was named in Monte Carlo last month: Narayana Murthy, Chairman of the Indian company Infosys Technologies. Participation in the traditional event in Monte Carlo provides not only an opportunity to represent Russia in the global arena and a chance to win the award. The elite of the business world assembles there at a kind of forum, to get to know like-minded persons and exchange ideas for business development. As Alexander Ivlev emphasized, the underlying idea of the competition is to make the worlds best business practices more widely known. In Russia, applications to participate in the competition will be accepted until August 1, 2003, and the winners will be named this November. Among the sponsors of the award program are the management company Yevrazkholding, Renessans Kapital, the agency Mikhaylov and Partners, and the U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship . The publishing house Kommersant is the media sponsor of the competition. As for the panel of judges for the Russian national Entrepreneur of the Year award program, its members include Yevgeny Yasin, Director of the Expert Institute, a scientific-charitable fund (NBF); Igor Yurgens, Vice-President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs; Yury Isayev, Deputy Minister of Economic Development and Trade of the Russian Federation; Viktor Vereshchagin, Deputy Director of the Expert Institute; Seppo Remes, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the European Business Club in Russia; Andrew Somers, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia; and Victor Sedov, Executive Director of the U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship . Alexander Ivlev stressed that representatives of Ernst & Young will not be members of the judging panel at any stage of the competition. After all, clients of the firm may be among the contenders, and besides, the rules of the competition forbid participation by any representatives of the sponsoring companies. Who can compete for the title of Top Entrepreneur of the Year? Those invited to participate are owners or heads of companies who currently have chief responsibility for their operation and who are actively participating in their management. This can also include the head of a state company who holds no share in it but possesses entrepreneurial qualities that are helping him turn it into a competitive participant in the market. Thus the competition is open both to company owners who are leaders of business and to young entrepreneurs. Not only contenders themselves, but also their colleagues, partners, or spouses can make nominations for the award. The criteria for determining the winners will include both quantitative indicators (growth of the companys turnover, increase in profits, and optimal use of human resources) and qualitative factors (innovation in business practices, development of original products, creative solutions in the area of marketing and sales, level of national and international market share). The organizers emphasize that information provided in connection with this competition will be considered strictly confidential and will be accessible only to members of the panel of judges. As Yevgeny Yasin, a member of the judging panel, remarked, this competition is an important event that can heighten the significance of entrepreneurship, raise the self-esteem of Russian entrepreneurs, and increase the entrepreneurs role and responsibility in expanding and developing our countrys economy. Author: Vladimir Gendlin Source: \n\t\t\t\"Kommersant-Dengi\", No. 29 (434), July 28, 2003 back My Business Magazine Media Partner OPORA Russia Copyright © 2002, The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship Design — Creative Marketing Group , Agency of Internet Technologies ltd Development — Agency of Internet Technologies ltd",

        "parsed_text": "The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship \n\n- News russian version News Monday, October 27, 2003, 5:43 pm  It Takes an Entrepreneur to Teach an Entrepreneur For the first time, the European conference of the Young Entrepreneurs Organization (YEO) will be held in Moscow on October 10  11, 2003.  The president of the organizations Moscow chapter, Mikhail Kupriyanov, discusses the unique opportunities YEO provides its members.  Kupriyanov is co-owner of Syscom 3000. Mikhail Kupriyanov, 36, graduated from the Red Banner Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense in 1989.  After serving in the armed forces, he worked in the telecommunications industry and in the IT business.  Since 2003, he is Director of Business Development for Syscom 3000. --What is YEO, and how is it different from other entrepreneur associations? --This organization is the fastest-growing world-wide organization of entrepreneurs.  It was created by entrepreneurs to foster development, education, and peer support.  To become a member, several criteria must be met.  I will list the most important.  First, you have to be an entrepreneur, not a hired manager (even at the highest level), but a founder, co-founder, key stockholder, owner, or co-owner of a business.  Second, your company has to have an annual turnover of at least $1,000,000.  And third, you must be under the age of 40. Why such restrictions?  Because a companys manager and owner do not have the same psychology.  Also, the threshold for annual turnover determines the degree of a businessmans success  his qualifications, if you will. Personally, I became acquainted with YEO in Paris, at the organizations 2002 European conference.  Right away I understood that it was just what I, as a businessman, needed. --What made such a striking impression on you? --I had been through various phases in business, learned a great deal, and acquired a certain amount of experience.  At some point I realized that I wasnt taking in anything new.  Why?  Well, for example, I wasnt convinced by consultants advice with their focus on theory.  They dont know what it means to run a business on a day-to-day basis.  There was no confidence there. And then we  a few Russian entrepreneurs  found ourselves in the midst of other people like us.  These people were possessors of a certain secret knowledge.  They knew what had to be done and how to do it. --Did you experience their support? --Yes.  We had an opportunity to find answers to virtually any question relating to business practice.  The economic effect of these contacts was colossal.  We heard new ideas, established ties with companies that were interesting business-wise, and got access to YEOs website, with its unique information about business. I felt that it is not right that Russia was excluded from this process.  So, during the trip the Russian delegates formed a Moscow chapter of YEO.  This became possible thanks to the assistance of the U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship.  YEO headquarters, which was quite surprised that there was no chapter in Russia, gave all kinds of support.  A decision was made at this time to hold the next European conference in Moscow. Do I need to tell you how important this event is for the country?  It means investment, new contacts, and an invigoration of economic ties. --What in particular is in store at the YEO conference? --The special feature will be the fact that, for many businessmen, this will be their first trip to .  Its absurd, but many truly imagine, if not bears in the streets, then of a mafia rampage along the lines of Chicago in the 1930s.  They are absolutely uninformed about the potential that has developed here. Organizationally, it will not be different from similar events.  Approximately 120 guests from various countries are expected.  The main concept is a traditional one  building bridges between businesses.  I hope the atmosphere will be relaxed and easy.  Many entrepreneurs will come with their families.  At the Paris conference there were even guests with children. --What does YEO give its members, besides peer contacts? --The educational programs, the so-called universities, are extremely useful.  The knowledge you gain with their help (how to launch a new project, how to attract an investor, etc.) is very valuable.  After all, the programs are put on by people who have actual experience of successfully implementing plans, attracting investors, etc.  The universities are held three or four times a year.  For example, this year Russian entrepreneurs attended in Australia. Any member of our organization can ask another member about an issue that concerns him at any time.  Thats the organizations tradition, its way of doing things.  Finding the person you need is easy; you use either the directory or the YEO website.  Admittedly, however, all these sources are for members only  access is granted after you join the organization. As for our Moscow chapter, I can say that contacts are most important.  In half an hour I can learn from a fellow entrepreneur what, in another situation, would take days, if not weeks. Theres another interesting way of working with the organization  forums.  These are events with open communication dealing with topics that may not seem to have direct connection with business.  Business is an extremely special kind of occupation.  At times this results in family problems.  And it can be useful to hear how your peers have solved problems of this kind. There are some taboos here.  Of course, spreading information obtained in the course of a forum is off limits.  And there is a ban on sales  when someone promotes his product or brand.  Incidentally, those two rules of conduct are written down in the YEO regulations.  There is also a ban on giving evaluations and advice.  That has to do with the fact that we recognize the value of each one among us.  A situation where someone says I would have done it this way unintentionally causes a feeling of rejection.  The logical conclusion drawn is that I am smarter than you.  Entrepreneurs are very sensitive about this.  Therefore, when someone shares a problem, they dont expect an evaluation or a piece of advice.  Instead, they listen as their peers talk about their experience in similar situations. What is important is that you stop feeling that you are alone, and that you realize that there are people who have been through similar difficulties and are ready to help you.  Believe me, this is very valuable for an entrepreneur. --How is the Moscow chapter of YEO organized? --Presently, there are eight people in the Moscow chapter.  They all come from different sectors of business: publishing, fast-food products, marketing, and others.  We are open to new members, but we are fairly strict in not chasing after new members.  Quality is far more important than quantity.  Plus, we dont want to ruin the atmosphere of openness and mutual assistance. Therefore, to join YEO you must have the recommendation and approval of member entrepreneurs.  There are dues as well  around $850 a year. You can find out more details about the activities of our organization on our website, www.yeo.org . In general, we try not to formalize our work any more than necessary.  We meet every month and make an effort to divide the meetings into several categories: meetings with important guests, discussions about useful contacts, excursions, and so on.  But nobody comes to our events because they feel they must. --Can such chapters emerge on a regional basis? --Of course. Soon a chapter will open in St. Petersburg.  The entrepreneurs in that city, after seeing our experience, understood that it would be right for them as well. The minimum number of members for a YEO chapter is three.  So, if there is a wish to organize this kind of thing, for example, in the Saratov business community, we are ready to help.  In general, I think that a number of such regional chapters will develop in Russia. --Are the activities of the Moscow chapter of YEO any different from those, say, of the Norwegian chapter? --Certainly. National characteristics can be very clearly traced.  I cant speak for the Norwegians because I simply havent had a lot to do with them.  The Americans, for example, adore informal contacts  like Boy Scout outings, you know.  For example, theyll all go rafting together.  Or, they will all go to somebodys ranch  all in shorts and t-shirts.  We dont do that kind of thing yet.  In general, we become close rather cautiously, gradually.  Probably that is a characteristic of the Russian businessman.  But in one thing we are all the same  we visit each others companies for the purpose of seeing how an unknown business operates.  The benefit these visits provide is appreciable. --What specific actions has the Moscow chapter carried out thus far? --I can mention the one we thought up and carried out jointly with the U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship.  Its director, Victor Sedov, helped organize a trip for Russian entrepreneurs to the United States.  There we met with representatives of businesses in the same field as our own.  The trip was short  ten days  but the return it yielded was enormous.  We were struck by the complete openness.  We were able to meet people about whom you read in the newspapers as if they were some kind of celestial beings.  And they talked about the hidden snags in their businesses; about the difficulties encountered at various stages of growth, and literally answered every one of our questions.  The contacts started then are ongoing today.

November 5, 2003. Delta Capital Management, manager of The US Russia Investment Fund, announced today that it is making a significant investment in USP Compulink. This investment will allow USP Compulink to expand its business to meet the rapidly growing needs of the Russian IT market.  [The Fund is the founder of The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship.] Compulink has been working in the Russia IT market since 1993. In 2002, the company was recognized by the leading analytical agencies as one of the fastest growing IT services companies in Russia. The Russian IT market is expected to grow 27% annually and reach $1.8 billion in 2005. This growth will be fuelled by the need of large Russian industrial companies to leverage IT to increase efficiency of operations; the emergence of rapidly growing medium size companies that must rely on IT systems to manage growth; and the increasing number of foreign companies establishing operations in Russia. Compulink provides a strong mix of system integration and high value-added consulting services. In 2003, Compulinks sales grew by 46% compared to the previous year.   The company maintains a strong client base, including MTS, Kazahtelecom, Promyshlenno-Strahovaya company, and Sberbank. In 2002, the company won a number of the most significant contracts of the \"Electronic Russia 2000-2010\" program. Compulink will establish itself as a leading national one-stop shop for IT services through a combination of two strategies: strengthening high value-added services (Management Consulting, ERP & CRM) and expanding geographically. Compulink believes it can gain substantial value by combining its brand, experience and scale with the local strengths of regional leaders. Delta Capital Management continues to actively invest in Russias rapidly developing companies. We believe the Russian economy will continue growing and we will have more such opportunities in the near future. Compulink is run by an energetic young management team with significant IT experience. We believe that the Funds investment will help the Company to expand its product offering and to become one of the industrys leaders, says Kirill Dmitriev, Vice President of Delta Capital Management. Director of USP Compulink Mikhail Lyastch adds, This investment will help us realize our long-term strategy, namely to create a multi-service company that is one of the leading one-stop shops for IT services in Russia. He added that this investment will facilitate Compulinks entering the IPO market. In 3 or 4 years, medium size companies will all have the same goal of entering the public markets. It is inevitable. Both the market and the state will benefit from this process. Having a public market for the stock ownership of such small and medium size businesses will result in the formation of a truly strong and independent middle class, which is essential for any democratic state. *** Delta Capital Management Delta Capital Management, manager of The U.S. Russia Investment Fund (the Fund), is a leading Russia-focused private equity fund manager dedicated to identifying and investing in emerging growth companies in Russia. Delta Capital Management focuses mainly, but not exclusively, on three high-growth sectors in Russia fuelled by high consumer demand: financial services, consumer products and services, and TMT (technology, media and telecommunications). Established in 1994, the Fund has invested in excess of $250 mln in 41 portfolio companies and has achieved eight successful exits.

Judges of the Business Breakthrough competition have come up with the top five finalists. The winner is to be determined by the results of the second round in February. The Business Breakthrough competition, a joint project of our magazine and the US-Russia Center for Entrepreneurship, aims at highlighting the experiences of young and fast-growing Russian companies. The main prize of the competition is a two-week business exchange trip to the United States, where a US counterpart company will be selected in the same industry as the winner. Each participant was awarded points on the basis of a system specifically designed for the competition by the Prado Group.  The five companies that scored the most points reached the second round. Regretfully, some contestants failed to completely fill out the questionnaire and were awarded fewer total points. Alan Abris, General Manager Andrei Kalashnikov The top score, 13.31, was awarded to a Penza-based company, Alan Abris, which manufactures a whole range of industrial products: repair and testing of valves and fittings, packaging, and mobile communication accessories.  The company was founded in 2000.  By 2002 it grew to 150 employees with a turnover of $1.2 million. Its success is a result of several factors.  The company invested in three new production facilities, and the mobile communication accessories business manufactures patent-protected items which are unique in the world.  Also worth mentioning is the fact that Alan Abris started Internet-based sales in Russian regions.  Vadim Samsonov, one of the competitions judges, noted that Alan Abris has become a leader, in spite of the face that it faces difficult challenges, such as implementing flexible manufacturing techniques to meet changing market situations. Lynx ÂCC, General Manager Igor Buchshtab Lynx BCC is a St. Petersburg-based IT company founded in 1997. By 2002, company turnover was $15.7 million with a staff of 69 people.  To Lynx, revenue growth of 187% in 2002 is their greatest achievement. Their score is 12.75 points.  All judges highly appraised Lynx performance, especially noting the complex ideas they turn into reality, and their competitors inability to copy them.  Indeed, some of Lynx technical and technological solutions cannot be copied due to their unique features. Since May 2003, the company has acted as Russia s first UNIX technology Competence Center . RightON, Partner Anna Babynina This Moscow-based company was founded in 1993 (it entered its current line of business in 1999) and offers auditing, evaluation, consultancy and legal services.  With 80 people on staff, it achieved $1.5 million in revenue in 2002. In their opinion, RightONs best achievement is being rating among the top ten Russian auditing and consultancy groups (compiled by Expert advertising agency in 2002).  RightON scored 12.38 points.  Judge Vadim Samsonov was impressed with how they achieved such prominence in such an extremely competitive market where only exclusive or top-quality service can guarantee market share.  However, they did not mention how they managed to achieve this high rating and market share, which did not earn them extra points in this competition.  A little side note: lack of information does not yield dividends, whether in this competition or in business. Pivtorg, Commercial Manager Alexei Kanevsky This Moscow-based company founded in 1996 imports and distributes beer.  They earned $10 million in 2002 and employed 120 staff.  Pivtorg considers their best achievement as being the highest seller of Ochakovo and Baltika beer in the Moscow region.  During the first round of the competition, Pivtorg won 11.9 points.  Judge Viktor Sedov noted that during the companys rapid development in its competitive market, it had to find unusual ways to compete. Kameo, General Manager Anton Kalabin Kameo is based in Moscow.  It was founded in 1997 and is a wholesale distributor of perfumes and cosmetics.  It was founded in 2002 and has a staff of 55 people.  The company scored 11.85 points.  Judges were impressed with Kameos market position and unique marketing solutions that give it a competitive edge in Gillette-branded product sales.  Unfortunately, all judges noted that a lack of corporate information, with some lines of the questionnaire saying data unavailable, prevented Kameo from winning more points. Panel of Judges Alexei Pismarov Strategic Partnership Development Manager, PRADO Group. 9 years business experience.  Created a profitable department from scratch; head of a group of advisers; supervises the Business Growth project. Igor Mann Marketing Director, Alcatel. 11 years business experience.  One of the most respectable market research advisers (Favor Co., Lucent Technologies).  Author of book 100% Marketing.

CFE, which provides educational and network learning events for entrepreneurs of growing companies, undertook this survey to assist it in meeting the specific needs of Russian entrepreneurs.  The questionnaire asked entrepreneurs of companies with annual revenues from $500,000 to $100+ million to rate the factors which influence their businesses development; their business-skills and personal development needs; and their preferred length, form and method of business training.  Responses were then analyzed and compared based upon gender and company revenue.  Official government statistics were also analyzed to determine the extent private mid-sized businesses contribute to the Moscow economy. A short summary of this research can be found on CFEs website ( http://www.cfe.ru/eng/center/?fid=24 ), that of our U.S. partner, the Foundation for Enterprise Development ( www.fed.org ), and the website of the Russian SME Resource Center ( www.rcsme.ru ).  The full report can be purchased from CFE in Russia and FED in the United States. ### The US Russia Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE) is the leading provider of education and network learning activities targeting the needs of growth entrepreneurs in Russia.  CFE serves Russian entrepreneurs to assist them in developing their companies, while facilitating the entrepreneurial process in Russia.  CFE promotes entrepreneurship as a positive force for economic vitality and social advancement by bringing together entrepreneurs with policymakers and investors in a learning environment that supports and advances the role and scope of entrepreneurship in Russia.  CFE is an initiative of the U.S. Russia Investment Fund (Delta Capital Management), a leading private equity fund in Russia, and is managed in cooperation with the Foundation for Enterprise Development. www.cfe.ru ### The Foundation for Enterprise Development is a leading U.S. non-profit education organization dedicated to building high-performing organizations, ensuring economic vitality and enhancing community well-being through entrepreneurship and employee ownership.  The Foundation has extensive experience designing and delivering programs internationally and for a decade has been assisting in educational program development for Russian entrepreneurs. www.fed.org ### The Russian SME Resource Center (RCSME) is a non-commercial foundation initially established under the Tacis program.  The mission of the Russian SME Resource Centre is to provide assistance to private entrepreneurship development in the Russian Federation.  It fulfills its mission by performing research into SME development, and providing policy advisory services and information support to the small and medium-sized business community. www.rcsme.ru back My Business Magazine Media Partner OPORA Russia Copyright © 2002, The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship Design — Creative Marketing Group , Agency of Internet Technologies ltd Development — Agency of Internet Technologies ltd",

The exclusive event  an annual regional conference for over 100 members of the Young Entrepreneurs Organization (YEO) and the World Entrepreneurs Organization (WEO)  was the first of its kind in Eastern and Central Europe since the demise of communism in 1990. Founded in 1987, the YEO and its alumnus the WEO, built on the principle that one learns the most from those who share similar experiences, have grown into a global entrepreneurial community, providing peer-to-peer networking and huge resources dedicated to fostering private entrepreneurship across the globe, the YEO officials said. Brien Biondi, the YEOs CEO for the past seven years, told TRJ that during this period YEO grew from 1,000 to 5,000 members, city and country membership rose from 40 to 140 cities and from six to 35 countries, respectively. Russia is vital to the YEO because it has huge, yet untapped business opportunities, making it a good place to be for the organizations.  Second, Russias membership has made the YEO a bigger, and therefore, a stronger network, he added. The YEO and WEO are a community of peers committed to the development of private entrepreneurship, Biondi said.  And, an entrepreneur is an entrepreneur anywhere, irrespective of his/her location, nationality, religion, political ideologies, race and other factors, he added. Not-a-free-for-all club, the YEO and WEO have stringent membership requirements which ensure only those meeting specific criteria can become YEOers and WEOers, as the organizations select few affectionately call themselves all over the world.  To become members of YEO, Biondi said, potential applicants recommended by current members must be less than 40, founded or co-founded, own or co-own a business or be majority shareholders of companies with gross annual revenues of not less than $1 million.  For the WEO, members are mainly graduates of the YEO, are at least 40 years old and are either owners or majority shareholders in companies with gross annual revenues of at least $7 million, he added. Biondi also spoke highly of the Moscow chapter, which joined the YEO only in February this year. Russian entrepreneurs have been fabulous, he said.  They have been actively engaged in the organizations activities since February.  The knowledge gained in this period has helped them generate new entrepreneurial ideas that have boosted their businesses, created new job opportunities, and improved the economy in general, he added. Victor Sedov, director of the Moscow-based U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship, said membership has boosted entrepreneurial activities among members.  In February, there were just four members in Moscow, but now we have 11.  At this rate, we are on course to hitting our target of enlisting 25 members in 2003, he noted.  For a comparison, France, with a much longer YEO history has just 20, he added. Mikhail Kurpiyanov, president of the YEOs Moscow chapter, also noted their fantastic progress over the past six months.  The fact that this high-level conference is taking place this year in Moscow, the organizations newest and youngest member, also testifies to the rapid growth and deepening co-operation between the chapter and its parent companies. Dmitri Agarunov, director of Gameland, a publishing company, said the atmosphere in the YEO provides a unique moral and psychological support that family members cannot provide. Here, in the organization among peers, one feels he is not alone, he added. Christian Courbois, general director of WestPost, a postal- and courier-services company, said he is currently in talks with the YEO executives to open a branch in St. Petersburg.  We want to establish a chapter because it will give members the opportunities to meet with their business peers and develop business contacts in all YEO member countries, he said.

The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE) was initiated by the U.S. Russia Investment Fund, which recently celebrated its tenth year in Russia.  The Fund invests in growth-oriented Russian companies for periods of three to five years, and has invested over $300 million. At the end of the day, any investment is made in people, not companies - no matter how remarkable they may be - and investors continually confront a shortage of professional managers and talented owners in Russia, stated Victor Sedov, Executive Director of CFE. At the workshop, the investment sector was represented by Quadriga Capital Russia .  Quadriga is interested in companies with good reputations in high-growth and technology industries.  The funds Director, Kendrik White, spoke about principles of private equity financing, investment criteria, and stages of the investment process.  He also let entrepreneurs know that they can apply for investment directly or via consultants. Mr. White noted Quadrigas investment in Nizhpharm as an example of a successful deal. When the investment was made, the company was rated seventeenth. Now, it ranks third and is a company with a transparent accounting system. The service sector was represented by Konstantin Gubin of the Russian-British company Rbpartners , who described how a professional service provider can help companies looking for investments.  He spoke in detail about the difference between due diligence and the audit, with the goal of an audit being to confirm the reliability of the accounting and financial data, and due diligence in trying to understand and evaluate the business.  At the end of the day, due diligence is about understanding if the business in question is indeed what the owners claim it is, said Mr. Gubin in conclusion. Larisa Yekimova, CFO of Sladkaya Zhizn ( SPAR Middle Volga ) , spoke about why Albert Gusev sought out investment, the search for an investor, and about the due diligence process.  The difficult thing to do, she said, is to let an outsider into the business that you have been building for years.  Before an entrepreneur searches for investment, they need to understand the benefits.  Mr. Gusev approached an investor because he lacked his own funds.  He spent about a year finding a partner and looking at various options. There is a huge debate as to the value of the company, since the investor is interested in buying cheap and the entrepreneur in selling for a lot, stated Ms. Yekimova.  It is very important to specify the terms and conditions under which the investor will exit the agreement.  Be prepared to spend on lawyers and consultants and maintain vigilance when entering the agreement, because every comma matters. Author: Yelena Tsareva Source: \n\t\t\tBirzha + Career (Nizhny Novgorod), November 9, 2004 back My Business Magazine Media Partner OPORA Russia (Association of Entrepreneurial Organizations) Copyright © 2002, The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship Design — Creative Marketing Group , Agency of Internet Technologies ltd Development — Agency of Internet Technologies ltd",

The template for the Association was the United States Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship (USASBE), which has been successfully operating in the USA for 52 years. Geralyn Franklin, President of USASBE, and Dean of the College of Business at the University of South Florida, came to Moscow specifically to tell her colleagues about the structure of USASBE, an organization that unites about 800 people disseminating knowledge about SMEs and entrepreneurship.  They include scholars, authors of training courses in psychology and dramatic art, as well as professors of classical business subjects.  USASBE members are entitled to free journals and information bulletins in the field of entrepreneurship; they improve their skills at seminars and workshops; and they meet annually for a major conference in various cities of the US.  USASBE is not confined to US practices, and is part of the International Council for Small Business. Following the above model, the Russian Association for Entrepreneurship Education will be able to identify the best Russian programs and use them as a basis on which to establish higher levels of training.  Association members will regularly take part in workshops and conferences abroad thus creating a bridge via which the most up-to-date entrepreneurial knowledge will enter this country. Ludmila Murgulets, Vice President of the Stockholm School of Economics in St. Petersburg, has been elected President of the Russian Association for Entrepreneurship Education. For details about the new business association, call the U.S.-Russia Center for Entrepreneurship at (495) 252-7927 or write to Ms. Alla Danilova of the center at: adanilova@cfe.ru .

FastTrac programs are resources for entrepreneurs that have been developed by and with hundreds of successful entrepreneurs who have shared their knowledge, insights, and stories so that others might learn from them. In 1998 FastTrac won the Small Business Administration`s Model of Excellence Award for Entrepreneurial Education. CFE offers FastTrac Planning as a nine module, 32.5 hour course that allows entrepreneurs to take a hard look at all aspects of their company and write a new business plan to address present and future needs and to help them manage their company on a daily basis. Entrepreneurs learn with a group of peers, entrepreneurs like themselves, who are working to improve their businesses. They also work with certified facilitators, people with real entrepreneurial business experience, who understand the challenges of operating and growing entrepreneurial business ventures. In this supportive environment, they incubate new business ideas, uncover areas that need reinforcing, and establish a foundation from which to make future decisions. © The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship 2010 Site Map Development — Webmaster.SPb",

The program fosters personalized experience and enables mentors to provide advice not only on business issues, but also general advice as many program participants are just beginning their careers. Mentors serve as a sounding board, provide a second opinion, share lessons from their experiences, and become a trusted long-term relationship. A mentor helps expand a new entrepreneur’s business and social network and access to senior decision makers. This one year program includes pre-program training to introduce both mentors and mentees to the skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary to be effective in their respective roles. Over the course of the year, mentors and mentees meet twice a month and mentees are invited to participate in two CFE Entrepreneurship Groups and two CFE 4-hour open enrollment seminars in order to provide a formal learning element to the program. In order to ensure success of this program, CFE has partnered with the International Business Leaders Forum which lends their program experience in conducting mentoring programs in 37 countries worldwide. © The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship 2010 Site Map Development — Webmaster.SPb",

We conducted surveys of entrepreneurs to determine and prioritize the specific training needs of Russian entrepreneurs and enlisted the expertise of worldwide experts and authors in developing the courses. Once the course was written, we translated, localized the material, and trained Russian entrepreneurs to be facilitators of these modules. Because of their effectiveness, our modules have been donated for use in Eastern Europe at the Centers for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development initiated by the Small Enterprise Assistance Funds with USAID support. Topics of CFE 4-hour learning modules include: Making Winning Presentations to Investors: How to Raise Money to Build Your Company By revealing the secrets of what investors look for in making an investment decision, the program helps entrepreneurs successfully pitch their companies — whether they have 60 minutes at a negotiation table, 6 minutes at a conference, or 60 seconds in an elevator.

Seminar authored by Bill McIntire, Kent State University (USA).

The workshop focuses on: Identifying the key factors that entrepreneurs must communicate to investors; What entrepreneurs must never say; What investors look for in making an investment decision; How to present the opportunity; How entrepreneurs should establish their credibility with investors; How entrepreneurs can enhance their image and stature in the minds of investors; Preparing for the presentation; Dealing with stage fright; and Structuring a clear and persuasive message for potential investors. At the end of the training session, a senior Investment Manager from Delta Capital Management, the leading private equity investor in Russia, will speak on what investors look for in potential investment target companies, and answer participants questions. Facilitators Dmitry Vechkanov and George Gorshkov are successful entrepreneurs and Partners at CMG strategy, a marketing consultancy founded in 1994 that works with major international clients, including American Express, PricewaterhouseCoopers, AIG and DeltaCredit, as well as entrepreneur-owned businesses.  Both have conducted seminars and master classes on marketing and business education for The British Council, the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia (AmCham), and the Academy of National Economy (ANE).  They also served as judges for AmChams MBA competition and ANEs business plan competition.  They were both awarded honors degrees from the Academy of National Economy.  As recipients of the Queens Award and the Chevening Awards, they earned their MBAs from the Imperial College Management School in London, which boasts the top-ranked school of entrepreneurship in Europe.  They were both nominated for the Ernst & Young \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" award in 2003. Time: Seminar from 14:00  18:00 What Past Seminar Participants Say: \"My new business partners and I formed a very aggressive business plan for year 2003.  It was a tough decision, because it was a first time for us to launch a really venture business in the high-tech industry, which required an involvement of an outside investor.  We compiled the presentation with some basic ideas.  We spoke about the opportunity , supported by third-party evidence and information.  We spoke about credibility , based on success stories and experience.  We proved our passion for what we do.  And, we calculated precisely the amount of investment funds needed.  The following week, we signed the investment agreement.  Please find our compliments and appreciation for your impact to this success.  It is the best practical implementation of a training session I could ever think of.\" Mikhail Kupriyanov, Syscom Official Information Date: Wednesday, November 5, 2003 Time: 2:00 pm Registration dead-line: Wednesday, November 5, 2003 Location: The President Hotel 24, Bolshaya Yakimanka St. Seminar in the Blue Room (2nd Floor) Language: Russian Fee: $125 (includes course materials, and coffee break) Information: contact@cfe.ru Copyright © 2002, The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship Design — Creative Marketing Group , Agency of Internet Technologies ltd Development — Agency of Internet Technologies ltd",

With a proper understanding of cash flow management, you can help ensure that your employees have the resources they need to grow your company. Cash Flow Management for Growth teaches entrepreneurs how to solve the cash flow problems faced by growing businesses. The seminar begins with the difference between profit and cash, followed by interactive discussion and problem-solving sessions on the sources and uses of cash in a growth business, the use of the right financial ratios to measure and monitor cash flow, and the relationship between growth and cash flow. Working with other entrepreneurs you will analyze a case study about a company in a cash flow crisis and develop operational strategies and tactics to help the company survive. This workshop focuses on you, the entrepreneur, and your understanding of the impact of cash flow on your company’s growth.

Wrong!  For those who can execute their strategy, the rewards are significant.  However, its one thing to craft a winning strategy, but successfully implementing it is another thing entirely.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of companies fail miserably when attempting to execute their strategies.  What is needed to successfully implement strategy is a system that provides real insight into an organizations operations, balances the historical accuracy of financial numbers with the real drivers of future performance, and helps align short-term actions with strategy.  One system that does this is the Balanced Scorecard. In this seminar, Implementing the Balanced Scorecard , you will get an in-depth, hands-on examination of the powerful Balanced Scorecard system. You will be exposed to all key facets of the Balanced Scorecard model, allowing you to take full advantage of this breakthrough tool in your own organization.  Through lecture, hands-on exercises, a real-life case study, and actual Balanced Scorecard success stories, you will learn: - How the Balanced Scorecard helps solve fundamental business issues; - How it translates vision and strategy into action; - How to define key performance measurement terms and concepts; - How to determine what to measure in each of the four Scorecard perspectives; and - How to communicate strategy on a strategy map. You will take away a set of tools you can use with your own strategy to develop a comprehensive set of balanced measurements to successfully drive your future results.

Hiring and Retaining Key Staff was developed by entrepreneurship expert, Dr. Jana Matthews, and addresses the essential issues of finding and keeping the best people in your company. Hiring Key Staff The hiring process can get derailed in many places.  In this seminar, youll learn to solve the common challenges of hiring, by developing a hiring process that works.  You will review your own hiring process, assess its strengths and weaknesses, and identify changes that need to be made.  We will address key questions, such as: What do we need to do before we start a hiring search? How do we identify the best candidates from the ones that are not right for us? How do we get people to reveal who they really are during the interview, not who they want us to think they are? Who should be moved from potential candidates to finalists? What questions should we ask when we do reference checks? How do we negotiate a win-win employment agreement? What red flags should we be watching for during the hiring process? Retaining Key Staff Knowing how to find the right people is just the beginning. You must be able to identify your key staff and retain them (and assess who might need to leave.)  This seminar will teach many of the ways to retain key staff and enable them to be peak performers, including: Getting your new employees off to a strong start. Setting clear performance expectations and measurements. Keeping your employees focused on your companys goals and plans Getting them to execute and produce results Rewarding and motivating your best people Understanding your employees expectations of respect, trust, communication and feedback, and involvement in planning the future of the company. How to manage situations where employees do not produce the expected results or fit with your companys culture Tools to decide whether employees are worth keeping, or whether they have to go. The Hiring and Retaining Key Staff workshop features a presentation and case study followed by an interactive discussion.  The seminar provides tools you can use in your company immediately to develop better job descriptions, conduct hiring interviews, and perform reference checks.  Well review a matrix of Performance and Values, develop a performance improvement plan, and discuss ways to have that difficult discussion with an employee  when you tell them they need to leave.  The seminar concludes with the creation of a Personal Action Plan that will prioritize changes youll need to make in your company.

Great marketing begins with a fundamental understanding of your market.  Consequently, this workshop addresses what entrepreneurs need to know about their customers and provides practical tools for helping entrepreneurs gain and keep customers!  By revealing key trends in the emerging marketplace and explaining what they mean, the program helps entrepreneurs develop and implement successful marketing strategies and tactics.

The workshop shows entrepreneurs how to utilize guerrilla marketing approaches to achieve high impact marketing results without spending large amounts of money.  Entrepreneurs can thus enhance their abilities to leverage resources, stretch resources, discover under-utilized resources and create their own resources.  In addition, by providing examples of a variety of guerrilla methods, the workshop will show entrepreneurs ways in which marketing can be used creatively to mitigate and manage the risks facing their firms. Too many entrepreneurs take a reactive and tactical approach to marketing.  This workshop shows entrepreneurs how to be more proactive and strategic and thus far more effective  in developing and implementing their firms entire marketing program.  In the process, entrepreneurs come to better understand the need for a close relationship between their customers buying process and their firms selling process. In addition to relevant examples and case studies, the program utilizes questionnaires and worksheets so that each entrepreneur walks away with a customized marketing plan that he or she can use to build their companies.  Through this program, entrepreneurs will learn how the right entrepreneurial marketing approach can lead to more profitable enterprises.

Time: Seminar from 9:00  13:00 What Past Seminar Participants Say: \"Its no doubt that I will use the recommended pricing strategy.  Up to now, prices for our companys products (instant oatmeal and kasha) have been pretty much in one price range.  However, we are starting to manufacture products oriented to people whose income is higher than middle-class, and who are health conscious (for example, different fitness-porridges), and therefore we are planning to apply different pricing methodologies for these products. Sergey Vykhodtsev, Bistroff Official Information Date: Wednesday, November 5, 2003 Time: 9:00 am Registration dead-line: Thursday, March 13, 2003 Location: The President Hotel 24, Bolshaya Yakimanka St. Seminar in the Blue Room (2nd Floor) Language: Russian Fee: $125 (includes course materials, and coffee break) Information: contact@cfe.ru Copyright © 2002, The U.S. Russia Center for Entrepreneurship Design — Creative Marketing Group , Agency of Internet Technologies ltd Development — Agency of Internet Technologies ltd",

Entrepreneurs usually have a good feel for their businesses.  They know their products and markets, and they can manage people.  Too often, however, entrepreneurs view financials as necessary but tedious and uninteresting aspects of their businesses that someone else, like an accountant, ought to deal with.  But research shows that the most successful entrepreneurs demonstrate real financial know-how about the critical numbers in their companies.  They recognize that financial statements are valuable sources of information, powerful planning mechanisms and essential tools for managing and growing their businesses faster and more profitably. This program gives entrepreneurs the tools to: Use financial statements in running and expanding their businesses; Read, understand and use critical financial information; Use financial statements to model their businesses; Detect business problems early, before they become critical; Improve their forecasting abilities; Create flash reports based on key financial balances, ratios and other metrics to help manage their businesses better; and Present financial information to bankers and investors more effectively. In addition to relevant examples and case studies, the program utilizes questionnaires and worksheets so that each entrepreneur walks away with a customized set of financial tools that he or she can use to help build their companies.  Through this practical and revealing program, entrepreneurs will learn how their financial statements can be powerful, compelling, interesting and insightful tools to build their companies. Author of the Seminar - Allan Edwin, Ph.D., is President of Edwin & Associates, which specializes in strategic and business planning; joint venture and strategic partnership negotiation; conflict resolution; capital formation; and operational consulting.  As an entrepreneur, Mr. Edwin started and was CEO for 10 years of Interactive Systems, Inc., a computer and communications company that he managed through three rounds of venture funding, and its acquisition by 3M.  Mr. Edwin is a Fellow of the Foundation for Enterprise Development, which has extensive experience in designing and delivering entrepreneurship programs in Russia and worldwide.

Dennis Bugrov from McKinsey & Company discussed Elements of Successful Growth Strategies, outlining examples of international companies, such as Gillette, that have remained strong by acquiring and creating new products (shaving crème, deodorant, etc.) to complement older products that have entered a mature life cycle (razors).  After Mr. Bugrovs presentation, Alexey Evgenev, General Director of Severstalmash, a large conglomerate, spoke about how his company successfully implemented McKinseys growth strategy recommendations.  Elena Chirkova, from Deloitte & Touche, expanded upon this theme and spoke about diversification, using companies such as Revlon, GE, as examples of companies that have used acquisitions to diversify and expand their business. Kirill Dimitriev of Delta Capital Management presented on what private equity funds look for in potential investment targets.  As the audience included growth entrepreneurs who are, or may seek private equity investment in the near future, Mr. Dimitriev outlined important factors in the decision by private equity fund to invest in a growth enterprise, including: Can the fund make money investing in this company? Who will be interested in buying the business in 3-4 years? How much will they pay? What factors will be important to the potential buyer? How much money must be invested, and in what business lines in order to maximize return on investment? How to motivate the management toward the planned sale of the company? CFE invited Vladimir Burenkov, Chair of the Russian Venture Capital Association, to speak about the state of venture capital in Russia.  He first outlined the distinction between venture and private equity capital, and stressed that private equity investment is more prevalent than venture capital because of the high-risk associated with venture investment in Russian start-up companies.  Mr. Burenkov then went on to outline the market sectors which have received the most direct investment, namely the food and telecommunications sectors (25.9% and 25.3% respectively). One of the most fascinating presentations was from Mr. Victor Saks, Director of Strategy and Development at 36.6 an entrepreneur-owned, fast growth pharmaceutical company with a retail chain of 55 pharmacies.  By 2002, 36.6 had a strong brand and a leadership position in its market.  However, it needed funding to support future growth through merger and acquisitions, as the Russian pharmacy industry is entering a phase of consolidation.  Mr. Saks outlined 36.6s decision to raise capital via a Russian IPO versus pursuing direct-equity investment.  36.6 chose an IPO because it gave its owners the best opportunity to retain control over the company, and it forced the company to become transparent, which will facilitate mergers and acquisitions and access to future capital.  Finally, a listing in Russia is obligatory before a company can issue ADRs, a long-term goal.  36.6 went public on February 6, 2003 and raised $14.4 million through the sale of 1.6 million shares, or 20% of the companys shares.

Corporate governance is the set of rules that define the relationship between a company, its shareholders and the community.  The more effectively entrepreneurs implement these rules, the better the relationships they build, and the faster their companies grow.  This workshop identifies the key provisions of the Russian Code of Corporate Governance and shows entrepreneurs how to adapt and apply them to their companies.  Through real-world examples and case-based scenarios, entrepreneurs will learn: How an effective disclosure policy will inspire investor confidence in the companys management; How to select, structure and work with a Board of Directors to better manage the company; How to best utilize outside auditors to insure credible financial reporting; What rights to provide shareholders and investors to keep them informed of company developments; and How to address conflicts between shareholders and management to maintain trust in the organization. This workshop will help entrepreneurs develop and implement practical solutions to corporate governance issues.  It will expose entrepreneurs to universally accepted good corporate governance practices so that they can develop a system that best fits their companys needs. Investors want to place their money in an enterprise that discloses everything they need to know about the company before investing, and then keeps them appraised on the progress of the company after they invest.  Through worksheets, cases, relevant examples and interactive discussion, entrepreneurs will walk away from this workshop with a customized corporate governance structure that can help them insure investor confidence and increase their chances of attracting capital.  They will learn the need for fair, timely and accurate disclosure of information, the optimal structure of their board of directors, and the powerful role of corporate governance in making their companies more successful. Course Developer and Facilitator Paul Kouris is a corporate attorney with extensive international experience counseling on matters relating to corporate governance, financing, employee ownership, privatization and securities issues.  He is a renowned corporate governance expert who has worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs and taught in several countries.

With the Young Entrepreneurs' Organization's (YEO) European membership growing at such an accelerated pace, this special YEO conference provided members with the chance to meet and network with their worldwide entrepreneurial peers. Many of the program's speakers talked on the theme: European Entrepreneurship: A New Reality -- the passion of business in Europe. Profiled speakers included Pierre Cuilleret, founder of The Phonehouse; Mark Dixon, founder of Regus; Glen Travers, biotech entrepreneur; and boat designer Bertrand Vogele of ACM. Other speakers at the three-day conference included: Jean-Francois Ott, a real estate investor in Eastern Europe; Verne Harnish, CEO of Gazelles, Inc.; Gary Hoover, founder of Hoovers Online and Bookstop; Robert Benninga, founder Mind Power International; Frank Mermoud from the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (trade), U.S. Department of State; as well as heavy-weight boxer Arnold Vanderlyde, an Olympic silver medalist, who drew parallels between success in sports and success in business. The conference opened with a welcoming reception at residence of the U.S. Ambassador of France Howard H. Leach. There was also a Peer-to-Peer Exchange  dialogue among participants in a round-table-style setting, and a Lessons-From-the-Edge Panel, where participants had the opportunity to hear and tell business stories by people who have been to the edge, overcame monumental hurdles, and not only survived, but thrived in their businesses. The Paris conference was the strongest event in Europe to take place to date, stated Brien Biondi, chief executive officer of YEO. The high-quality learning program was very well received by all who attended. We look forward to the 2003 European Conference taking place in Russia, which will be hosted by our newest YEO chapter located in Moscow. Further information about YEO can be obtained online from www.yeo.org .

At present its membership includes only 11 Moscow businessmen, all under the age of 40. Therefore one of the conference's goals was to help entrepreneurs from other Russian cities who wanted to join YEO become familiar with the organization. First in line was St. Petersburg, represented by American Christian Courbois at the Moscow meeting. In 1995 he founded the firm of WestPost (a postal and courier company) in the city on the Neva, and since then he has considered himself a Russian entrepreneur. Im attracted to YEO by the opportunity to get to know people who think the same way I do, says Courbois. Vadim Artamonov, the owner of ABC Trading Group, has a young but fast-growing company. He joined YEO several months ago. I feel as if I had started looking 10 years into the future, Artamonov says, describing the effect of mixing with fellow members of the organization. The unique feature of YEO is that is not a lobbying organization, but a professional organization of entrepreneurs. Its members openly share information with each other about the ways they solve various business problems in practice. And the problems of small and medium-sized businesses in various countries are quite similar. As My Business was told by Brien Biondi, the CEO of the Young Entrepreneurs Organization, the biggest problem facing YEO members is selecting and motivating personnel. The search for financial resources to assist growth is only in second place.

Первым выступил Владимир Малышев, представив проект TUTGRUZ-онлайн сервис грузовых перевозок. Цель проекта: создание онлайн сервиса, объединяющего большинство водителей, диспетчеров, транспортных компаний, грузовладельцев России и ближнего зарубежья. Стартап позволит решить следующие задачи: создание сервиса прямого взаимодействия перевозчиков и грузовладельцев; развитие малого предпринимательства и его безопасной работы; организация учета перевозок в России и ближайшем зарубежье; увеличение товарно-транспортных отношений России, ЕС, СНГ, а в особенности Ближнего Востока, с помощью сокращения издержек на перевозку дешевых грузов с прицепом. Предпринимательское сообщество высказало ряд опасений, рисков: защита маржи; легко скопировать платформу, поэтому необходимо продумать техническую составляющую проекта; завышена оценка. Вторым спикером стал основатель и руководитель компании «Banki.shop» Роман Корников. «Banki.shop» — это цифровая платформа, первая в своем роде, способная заменить человека в должности Кредитный специалист, либо дополнить этой компетенцией специалиста у застройщика или в банке. Данная платформа решает следующие проблемы, с которыми борется каждая компания: Сложность сбора данных по кредитным программам и поддержания их актуальности. Необходимость долгого обучения сотрудника, существующие решения сложны для внедрения. Хорошо обученный специалист стоит дорого. Снижение времени при подаче заявки в банк с 4-ч часов до 50 минут. Низкая эффективность подбора кредитной программы даже у обученного специалиста. Предпринимательское сообщество посчитало проект интересным, во время мероприятия были установлены контакты и найден потенциальный партнёр и инвестор проекта. Роман Шмигирилов рассказал о компании «VectorMOO» - программно-аппаратном комплексе для мониторинга и нейросетевого анализа показателей молочных хозяйств, который также представляет собой систему диагностики болезней. Преимущества комплекса состоят в мониторинге состояния крупного рогатого скота и как следствие продления дойного периода и повышения количества и качества молока. Прогнозируемая окупаемость внедрения - 1 год. Экспертное сообщество порекомендовало сделать акценты на следующие важные моменты: какая практическая польза будет хозяйствам от внедрения этого комплекса; сколько данное устройство позволит сэкономить; протоколы о намерениях, прочие материалы с потенциальными заказчиками. Завершил конференцию Александр Шиповский, руководитель и основатель проекта «DeltaCNC» - беспилотного мотодельтаплана для сельскохозяйственных работ. Беспилотный мотодельтаплан это: высокая производительность сельскохозяйственных работ (до 1400 га/сутки) за счет возможности полета в ночное время суток; эффективное использование технологии ультрамалообъемного опрыскивания (УМО), что снижает расход пестицидов на 10-15 % и, соответственно, стоимость работ, т.к. ночью химикаты не испаряются; безопасность для жизни человека и отсутствие влияния утомляемости за счет применения автопилота; повышенная точность внесения гербицидов за счет возможности опрыскивания в ночное время суток, когда погода наиболее благоприятна. Данный проект вызвал интерес у участников, однако была отмечена долгая окупаемость. Спикеру посоветовали обратиться за грантами к профильным акселераторам. Следующая онлайн-встреча состоится 13 января 2021 в 18.00 по мск.

Первым выступил Урванцев Константин, рассказав о проекте «Altairika», онлайн-школе, практикующей адаптивное дистанционное обучение. У компании два направления: VR обучение, которое представлено в 18 странах мира и работает по франшизе, и онлайн-школа. Основатели проекта видят следующие задачи в онлайн-образовании: научить детей думать, находить и анализировать информацию. Сама программа подразумевает индивидуальный подход, с учётом профориентации школьника. Вторым спикером стал основатель и руководитель компании «SellerPlace» Игнат Силкин с проектом системных продаж на маркетплейсах. Он рассказал, что имеет колоссальный опыт развития офлайн-продаж, но пандемия внесла серьезные ограничения в развитие бизнеса, что натолкнуло на развитие нового направления. Цель его проекта заключается в построении системного бизнеса по управлению ассортиментом и продажами на маркетплейсах. Максим Олейников рассказал о стартапе «Cleanbotics», роботах для профессиональной уборки помещений. Его проект – это семейство умных роботов, которые в сочетании с сервисной станцией позволяют автоматизировать рутинные процессы уборки помещений на 99%. Мытье пола, подзарядка, слив грязной воды и залив чистой, добавление моющего средства – все это происходит без участия человека. Рекомендация от венчурного инвестора состояла в том, что необходимо обратиться в специализированный акселератор, наметить стратегию привлечения следующего раунда инвестиций, определиться со стратегией. Все проекты вызвали интерес среди предпринимательского сообщества, были установлены деловые контакты для дальнейших консультаций и достижения взаимовыгодного сотрудничества.

Первым выступил Иван Хаустов, представив проект Legium. io - сервис электронного подписания документов за 5 секунд для людей и компаний. Дистанционная и бесплатная регистрация, работающая на любом устройстве. Сервис подойдет для подписания документов с поставщиком, фрилансером или сотрудником компании. Legium. io, в отличие от аналогов, имеет ряд преимуществ: без флешек - даже на телефоне; без настроек - все работает сразу; без контакта с человеком; без платы за регистрацию; без платы за входящие документы; без бумаги. На сегодняшний день уже есть пул клиентов: Мэйл.ру Групп, Skillbox, X5 Retail Group, Додо Пицца, Фастзила, Рокет Ворк (Рокетбанк), СберЛогистика. Проект вызвал интерес среди предпринимательского сообщества, были установлены деловые контакты для дальнейших консультаций и поиска взаимовыгодного сотрудничества. Вторым спикером стал основатель и руководитель компании Tesla Connect Кирилл Сосновый. Проект объединяет людей в экосистему Tesla, делает электромобили доступными в России. Основатели создали экосистему для Tesla в России, собираются реализовать суперапп с арендой авто, картой зарядок, вызовом сервиса, возможностью предзаказа автомобиля и комьюнити. Компания имеет продажи, бизнес-модель построена следующим образом: привлекают клиентов на почасовую аренду Tesla с инструктором, в формате экскурсии в мир электромобилей. Аренда позволяет получать клиентов на покупку самих Tesla, на данный момент продано 7 автомобилей. За декабрь 2020 года компания реализовала 435 часов аренды. Рахимова Виктория рассказала о проекте B2B-Export - это облачная платформа для управления кросс-граничной торговлей с Россией. С 2017 года компания занимается инновациями в очень традиционной и консервативной области международных продаж (SaleTech) и обладает дешевой технологией привлечения зарубежных b2b-покупателей российской промышленной продукции и поставщиков из стран Латинской Америки, Африки и Южной Азии. С 2019 года также развивает FoodTech платформу по импорту продовольствия в Россию и экспорту продовольствия из России в формате B2B. Команда является выпускниками ИТ-кластера Инновационного центра Сколково. Были резидентами Сколково во время разработки платформы, а с января 2018 года переехали в юрисдикцию с английским правом для монетизации технологии и расширения рынков присутствия. Цель компании - стать платформой №1 для межрегиональной и внутрирегиональной b2b-торговли для СМБ из России и развивающихся стран, не имеющих доступа к экспорту.

Первым выступил Данилин Алексей, представив проект «Платформа прямых контрактов 100ТЗ.рф». Платформа организует взаимодействие поставщиков и заказчиков рынка госзакупок и стройматериалов. Поставщики получают заказы на продукцию по своей категории в формате спецификаций с подобранными по прайс-листам товарами. Госзаказчики получают автоматизированное составление заявки на торги: план закупок, спецификация, КТРУ, НМЦК и гарантию поставки товара по заказу. Строители экономят от 10% до 40% и получают экспертное предложение по специализированным разделам ПСД, а торговые компании получают объем заказов по строительству и торгам в своем регионе. Вторым спикером стала основательница и руководитель компании «LuckyTok» Синкевич Ирина. «LuckyTok» — это Saas-cервис по автоматическому продвижению и заработку в Тикток. Пользователям предоставляется платный доступ к сервису, где они регистрируют свой тикток-аккаунт. Сервис, путем автоматических действий (автоподписка, автолайкинг, автоотписка) без участия пользователя продвигает прикрепленный аккаунт и собирает подписки и лайки от других пользователей. За месяц сервис собирает для одного пользователя порядка 5000 подписчиков. Для тех пользователей, кто хочет заработать на сервисе, внедрена трехуровневая реферальная система. Еще на этапе анонсирования мероприятия, был проявлен интерес к данному проекту. По итогам выступления ряд экспертов в области маркетинга и рекламы вызвались протестировать сервис и дать обратную связь предпринимательскому сообществу на предмет инвестиционной привлекательности проекта, его жизнеспособности и перспективности. Третий спикер, Кругов Данил, рассказал о компании «Оптимум Прайс». Компания работает с 2011 года по собственной технологии усиления фундаментов и выполнила сотни проектов по России. Она вышла на рынки Сербии, Польши, Азербайджана, Армении, Беларуси. Компании необходимо финансирование для выхода в страны ЕС, США, Канаду, Азию. Эксперты предложили, в том числе, переделать маркетинговую стратегию компании: поменять подачу материала, также актуализировать информацию на сайте.

Руководить работой B20 в 2019 году будет Федерация бизнеса Японии ( Кэйданрэн ) /Keidanren, Japan Business Federation. Ключевое событие – саммит B20 пройдет в Токио 14-15 марта 2019 г. От каждой страны на саммит приглашены 10 представителей, среди которых в составе российской делегации, сформированной и утвержденной РСПП – генеральный директор ООО «Центр Предпринимательства» Виктор Седов. Делегацию возглавляет Александр Шохин, среди членов делегации – такие известные представители российского бизнеса как Кирилл Дмитриев, Андрей Костин, Давид Якобашвили. В качестве основной темы для лидеров стран-членов «Группы двадцати» японское председательство предложило тему « Общество 5.0 для реализации Целей устойчивого развития (ЦУР) ». Сегодня цифровые технологии вносят серьезные изменения не только в экономику, но и в развитие всего общества. В ноябре прошлого года Кайданрен опубликовал концепцию « Сообщество 5.0: совместное творчество будущего », которая направлена на то, чтобы концепцию делиться знаниями и укреплять сотрудничество между разными отраслями экономики, промышленностью, научными кругами и правительством в целях создания нового человекоориентированного общества. Центральная часть концепции – Общество 5.0 – основано на идее, что человеческое общество переходит на пятую стадию развития. Вслед за Обществом Охоты, Аграрным Обществом, Индустриальным Обществом и Информационным Обществом пятым этапом станет Творческое Общество, в котором сочетание цифровой трансформации, воображения и творчества разных людей позволит решать проблемы, с которыми сталкивается общество и создавать новые ценности». «Я верю, что эффективное использование Интернета вещей и искусственного интеллекта позволит всем нам использовать человеческий творческий потенциал и создавать новое общество будущего, используя передовые технологии», – коментирует председатель Федерации бизнеса Японии (Кэйданрэн) Наканиси Хироаки (Hiroaki NAKANISHI).

Организаторы круглого стола: зав. каф. Г и Р Б Степанова Светлана, доценты Кущева Наталия (модератор) и Бедяева Татьяна. В заседании круглого стола приняли участие магистранты первого и второго года обучения, а также выпускники кафедры, которые являются профессионалами гостиничного бизнеса. Так, например, на встрече присутствовал директор отелей Golden Tulip и Tulip Inn Роза Хутор по продажам и маркетингу, выпускник кафедры 2000 года, Сазонов Игорь Николаевич. Основными вопросами, которые обсуждались во время круглого стола, были проблемы выживания предприятий сферы общественного питания во время пандемии 2020 года. Обсудили и важные вопросы сферы гостеприимства: загрузку средств размещения, выполнение санитарных норм и стандартов. Это касалось не только крупных отелей Санкт-Петербурга таких как SO/St. Petersburg и Астория, но и апартаментных средств размещения, о которых рассказала магистрант программы «Управление гостиничным бизнесом», управляющая группы сервисных апартаментов «Five Stars», Хмелюк Наталья Геннадьевна. Пандемия 2020 года создала проблемы в процессах обучения и организации студенческих практик, но благодаря партнерским отношениям с предприятиями гостиничного бизнеса и высокой заинтересованностью студентов, их удалось решить. Магистранты первого года обучения Бакарева Ксения и Дудинова Мария поделились своим опытом прохождения преддипломной практики в дистанционной форме, с выездом на предприятие. Работа круглого стола продолжалась более 3 часов, выступления спикеров были интересны и актуальны, в процессе встречи возникали важные практические вопросы, которые касались всей сферы гостеприимства. Спасибо всем участникам: Магистрантам первого года обучения программы «Управление гостиничным бизнесом»: Бурухину Сергею, Никоновой Алене, Золотухину Николаю, Дудиновой Марии, Бакаревой Ксении. Магистрантам второго года обучения программы «Управление гостиничным бизнесом»: Федяевой Алене и Богданову Никите. Большая благодарность Хмелюк Наталье Геннадьевне, магистранту заочной формы обучения программы «Управление гостиничным бизнесом» и выпускнику кафедры 2000г. Сазонову Игорю Николаевичу.

Представленные инициативы получили оценку и рекомендации по дальнейшим шагам от присутствующих экспертов: членов «Деловой России», менторов, инвесторов, представителей предпринимательского сообщества. Встреча приурочена к Всемирной неделе предпринимательства (ВНП), которую в России проводит соорганизатор мероприятий Startup клуба — Центр предпринимательства. 19 ноября — день ВНП, посвященный стартапам: мероприятия, связанные с ними, прошли по всей стране «Сегодня мы решили уделить внимание  теме, которая еще недавно казалась экзотической и в каком-то смысле благотворительной. Еще 3–4 года назад можно было по пальцам пересчитать компании, которое в России работают в этой области, но сейчас это уже стандарт — все понимают эффективность, что это коммерчески выгодно, интересно, а не только модно» , — прокомментировал актуальность встречи глава Startup клуба Денис Дидковский. Модератором встречи выступил партнёр CBI Pioneer, эксперт по инвестиционной привлекательности и региональным институтам развития Дмитрий Ягодкин. Участники встречи представили шесть проектов. Производственный комплекс по переработке пластиковых отходов и изготовлению инновационных продуктов для дорожной безопасности Член генерального совета «Деловой России» Алексей Кучмин рассказал о своей компании «АИР Магистраль», которая в 2019 году открыла производственный комплекс по переработке пластиковых отходов в Московской области. По его словам, один из наиболее перспективных продуктов компании — это композитные направляющие устройства, которые могут широко применяться для организации безопасного дорожного движения: от барьерного разделения до парковочных ограждений. Компания ищет, в первую очередь, поставщиков сырья для переработки (пакеты и упаковочная пленка, тюбики, канистры). Гиромобиль — компактный электромобиль Александр Казарцев представил транспортное средство нового технологического уклада, предназначенное для круглогодичного движения в условиях дорожных пробок. Трицикл работает под управлением активной цифровой системы стабилизации, поэтому устойчив при ширине всего 92–96 см, что определяет преимущества перед автомобилями (может передвигаться в пробках) и мотоциклами (может использоваться зимой). Автор проекта, по его словам, сам передвигается по Москве на таком трицикле. Команда проекта ищет инвесторов для запуска серийного производства. ЭЗС «Чистая энергия» Виталий Марков рассказал о проекте сети сверхбыстрых зарядных станций для электромобилей в Кемеровской области. Авторы проекта считают основной причиной непопулярности электромобилей в России отсутствие инфраструктуры для их обслуживания. ЭЗС «Чистая энергия», — это сеть станций быстрой зарядки, где электромобили можно заряжать с помощью полностью возобновляемых источников энергии за 15 минут. В России аналогов этому проекту нет. Компания заявила о поиске инвесторов. Защита инженерных сетей и оборудования от коррозии Сергей Гризак выступил с презентацией услуг инжиниринговой компании «Аквамир», которая занимается внедрением современных методов очистки воды, систем водооборота и очистки сточных вод, а также проектированием и монтажом оборудования по водоочистке и очистке сточных вод. Проект по защите инженерных сетей и оборудования от коррозии предусматривает установку и настройку оборудования в системах распределения холодной и горячей питьевой воды в жилых микрорайонах, многоквартирных домах и на промышленных предприятиях. Предлагаемое оборудование рассчитывает необходимую дозу ингибитора коррозии и впрыскивает его в поток воды. Компания ищет инвесторов для запуска проекта, административную, информационную и финансовую поддержку. Комплекс термического обезвреживания осадков сточных вод методом пиролиза-газификации Андрей Баянкин рассказал о трехэтапной системе обезвреживания сточных вод, которую разработала компания «СЭГ ТЕХ». Предлагаемая разработка в четыре раза снижает объем опасного осадка сточных вод. Авторы проекта заинтересованы в информационной поддержке, участии в тендерах, инвестициях и финансировании, а также попросили экспертов оценить, попадает ли проект в потребности водоканалов и удачна ли его бизнес-модель. «Экотранс» — перевод парков транспорта и техники на альтернативное топливо Алексей Гришко представил проект, который предполагает переоборудование дизельных двигателей для работы в двухтопливном режиме. По подсчетам авторов проекта, его реализация позволит снизить расходы на покупку топлива на 20–30% и сократить вредные выбросы от транспорта и техники. Проект уже реализуется в пилотном режиме совместно с несколькими крупными предприятиями. Компания ищет партнеров для испытаний и доводки решения в условиях реальной эксплуатации, а также возможности для масштабирования. Ближайшие встречи Startup клуба запланированы на 3 декабря (Арктика) и 17 декабря (искусственный интеллект).

Мероприятие прошло в рамках Всемирной недели предпринимательства. ⠀ Модераторами питч-сессии выступили: Алина Рыбина, социальный технолог, эксперт в области создания деловых и профессиональных сообществ. Альбина Макаева, вице-президент Национальной Ассоциации «Генетика», Мастер делового администрирования Российской академии народного хозяйства и государственной службы при Президенте РФ, эксперт в области применения систем искусственного интеллекта в здравоохранении. ⠀ Открыл Startup Huddle Александр Наследников, презентовав свой проект Med.me - инновационные решения в сфере цифровой медицины. Med.me разрабатывает собственную базу интеграций с МИС и ЛИС клиник и лабораторий, позволяя им вести связь с внешним миром через единую систему. Проект включает онлайн-запись для пациентов, PRM (рабочий кабинет) для клиник, модуль электронной медицинской карты, модуль взаимодействия со страховыми компаниями, электронные рецепты и телемедицины, а также мобильное приложение для пациентов. ⠀ Анна Мещерякова, CEO компании «Третье мнение», представила проект COVID-19 tech. Компания фокусируется на системе поддержки принятия врачебных решений, работая с двумя типами медицинских данных - медицинские диагностические изображения и видеопоток из медицинских организаций. Работа искусственного интеллекта по обработке данных особенно важна сейчас - в период высокой загруженности медицинских учреждений. Например, разработки компании помогают автоматизировать процессы диагностики медицинских изображений на предмет поиска признаков воспалительных заболеваний по анализу крови, обнаружения признаков пневмонии, COVID-19, рака легкого на рентгенограммах и КТ, диагностики осложнений сахарного диабета, обнаружения признаков молочной железы на маммограммах.

Модератором встречи выступил предприниматель, основатель и управляющий партнёр СОВЕТ#1 Семён Фомин. Цифровой выставочный центр Вице-президент Ассоциации экспортеров и импортеров Павел Долгов обратил внимание на актуальную тему 2020 года – невозможность многих отраслей бизнеса, а в особенности выставочной деятельности, функционировать оффлайн. Он представил платформу для массовых online-мероприятий и виртуальных выставок в 3D-формате, которая является технологическим решением для организаторов мероприятий. Специальные технологии позволяют создавать залы по направлениям виртуальной выставки, а также проводить ежедневные трансляции. Компания планирует выйти на рынки Арабских Эмиратов, Европы  и Ближнего Востока. Эксперты отдельно оценили, что команда проекта оформила протоколы защиты персональных данных в соответствии с Европейским законодательством, посоветовали сделать акцент на масштабировании, интеграции бизнес-модели и программном решении. Интерактивный робот-оператор call-центра «ZvonoBot» Игорь Ганин представил SAAS-сервис, который помогает автоматизировать исходящие и входящие звонки. ZvonoBot заменяет операторов колл-центра: он может распознавать слова собеседника, синтезировать ответы и полноценно вести разговор так, что человек часто даже не замечает, что разговаривает с роботом. В ближайшие пять лет компания планирует выйти на оборот 1 млрд руб. в год, поэтому она ищет инвесторов и партнеров, а также заинтересована в консультации по стратегии выхода на международный рынок. В данный момент команда проекта разрабатывает модуль речевой аналитики совместно со Сколково. Экспертное сообщество посоветовало обратить внимание на те страны, где есть проблемы с комплектацией call-центров (например, Иран) и работать там с переводческими компаниями. Также эксперты обратили внимание на проблему блокировки спам-звонков многими операторами. Во время мероприятия были установлены контакты для продолжения личного общения и возможного сотрудничества. Онлайн-сервис для поддержания и развития языковых коммуникативных навыков на всех языках «Polygled» Татьяна Чибиняева представила международную языковую платформу Polygled. Спикер обратила внимание, что все возрастные категории, испытывающие потребность в общении на иностранных языках, объединяются с учетом общих интересов в формате клубов и встреч один на один. Уникальное решение, которое предлагает команда проекта, состоит в создании условий, чтобы пользователь не забыл язык, в возможности постоянной практики. Для тех, кто хочет большего, платформа Polygled также располагает курсами, базой репетиторов и другими возможностями для повышения уровня языка. Созданная по нейролингвистической методике и основанная на разнообразии модерируемых форматов коммуникаций, платформа включает web-сайт и приложения, свои каналы, чат, социальные профили пользователей, персональные лэндинги клубов и курсов и др. Эксперты оценили перспективность концепции проекта и в особенности наличие в команде профессиональных лингвистов. Участники встречи посоветовали обратить больше внимание на позиционирование, также поступило предложение к кооперации по интеграции игровой механики для упрощенного восприятия информации. Биометрические платформы «OzForenzics» Светлана Ефимова рассказала о биометрической платформе, которая может проверять подлинность изображения, сравнивать лица, определять живого человека в кадре. Спикер отметила, что потери от идентификационного мошенничества в мире в 2019 году достигли 16,9 млрд долл. Авторы проекта обещают защитить своих клиентов от него с точностью до 99,87%. Светлана также выделила приоритетные страны для экспорта, среди которых Перу, Аргентина, Бразилия и Мексика. Во время обсуждения сессии стартапу поступило несколько предложений о сотрудничестве и возможности нетворкинга с крупными иностранными компаниями из Арабских Эмиратов, Ирландии, а также о возможности кооперации с IT-хабом в Дубае. Эксперты обратили внимание на растущий рынок идентификации и большую международную конкуренция в сфере e-commerce. Следующая встреча для проектов, направленных на экспорт, планируется в феврале.

В Подмосковье за несколько месяцев тренинги посетило более 700 человек из 10 городов, расположенных в области. Обучение бесплатное и доступно всем желающим. Мой выбор в обучающих программах пал на двухдневный экспресс-курс, который проводился в городе Красногорске. Слушателями семинара в этот раз стали студенты одного из местных колледжей. Впрочем, каждый раз эксперты центра «Мой бизнес» формируют аудиторию согласно тому или иному виду деятельности. То есть опытных предпринимателей никогда не посадят с начинающими или с теми, кто только мечтает открыть свое дело. Важно - чтобы программы были эффективны. - Программа «Финансовая грамотность и стратегическое ведение бизнеса» реализуется в рамках национального проекта по предпринимательству при поддержке Министерства экономического развития Российской Федерации, Правительства Московской области, Департамента инвестиционной и промышленной политики города Москвы и центра «Мой бизнес». Аудитория тут собирается самая обширная: действующие предприниматели, начинающие бизнесмены, матери-одиночки, студенты, школьники, пенсионеры и инвалиды. К каждой группе необходим свой индивидуальный подход. Нельзя рассказывать про стратегию ведения бизнеса опытному бизнесмену и начинающему предпринимателю одновременно. Под каждую аудиторию мы подбираем определенную методику и тренера. Впрочем, тема, по сути, одна - стратегия ведения бизнеса и финансовая грамотность , - рассказала Елена Соколова, куратор программы семинаров . По словам Соколовой, экспресс-сессии для предпринимателей по стратегии ведения бизнеса и финансовой грамотности проходят в течение полных двух дней, что составляет примерно 16 часов. Предпринимателей учат, как правильно платить налоги и вести бухгалтерию. Ну и конечно, как грамотно выстраивать стратегию развития бизнеса. В рамках обучения-интенсива преподаватели дают основные инструменты грамотного ведения бизнеса с разбором кейсов и выполнением конкретных заданий. Слушатели получают полезную информацию и обратную связь по выполненным заданиям от своих наставников. Также на тренингах предприниматели знакомятся между собой, приобретают новые контакты. Куратор также отметила, бизнес-тренеры открыты для обсуждения важных решений по вопросам ведения бизнеса при разборе конкретных примеров. - Бизнес-тренеры имеют сертификаты, для каждой группы аудитории подбираются Московским областным центром поддержки предпринимательства в Красногорске в индивидуальном порядке с учетом особенностей аудитории, тактики подачи информации , - рассказала Елена Соколова . - Спикеры имеют огромный опыт ведения собственного бизнеса. По данным куратора, пилотными тренинга-интенсива взяты города, где присутствуют центры «Мой бизнес». В Подмосковье это 11 городов, среди которых Можайск, Ногинск, Реутов, Дмитров, Коломна и другие. В этом году по программе отучились 732 человека, до 15 декабря в планах обучить 1000 человек. УЧЕБНЫЙ ПРОЦЕСС На занятии студентам были даны азы предпринимательского дела. Так как это молодежь, тренер работал в несколько игровой форме. Здешним студентам курс читала опытный предприниматель и бизнес-тренер Екатерина Васильева, генеральный директор ООО «Пинг-ИТ» . - Сегодняшний курс - базовый, который по большей части содержит теоретическую информацию. Также мы даем практические задания, которые позволяют разобраться в какой-то рабочей ситуации и построить бизнес-стратегию. Во время занятий слушатели могут задать интересующие их вопросы , - пояснила «КП» Екатерина Васильева . В сегодняшнем занятии упор сделан на методы сбора информации. - В основном это теория на тему сбора информации и ее анализа, - говорит тренер. - Для студентов мы больше говорим про внешнее окружение, ведь своей компании у них еще нет. А также мы рассказываем о методиках, которые позволяют грамотно анализировать и делать выводы, и уже на их основании создавать стратегию, как лучше строить свой бизнес на определенный период. Эти инструменты применимы не только в бизнесе, но и в жизни - к примеру, SWOT-анализ, PEST-анализ, АВС-анализ и другие методики. Самое главное, что пытаются донести на тренингах, - это понимание того, насколько важно грамотно поставить себе цель и дать себе ответы, куда и как мы идем. И если бизнес на каких-то этапах не достигает определенного уровня развития, то надо разобраться почему и скорректировать свои действия. Иногда случается так, что цель поставлена таким образом, что ее невозможно достигнуть. - Этот блок у слушателей вызывает наибольшее количество инсайтов, то есть люди понимают, что я говорю очевидные вещи, но вдруг им становится ясно - никто из них в это глубоко не погружался, а потому недооценивал ситуацию , - добавила Екатерина Васильева .

Центр предпринимательства при поддержке Правительства Московской области бесплатно провел занятия по основам ведения бизнеса и повышению финансовой грамотности. 28-29 ноября в коворкинг-центре «На старт» собралась разноплановая аудитория: были и действующие предприниматели (владельцы языковых школ, фитнес-клубов и различных магазинов), и пенсионеры, и студенты Дмитровского института непрерывного образования (ДИНО), обучающиеся по самым разным специальностям. Сертифицированные тренеры программы отмечают, что обучение в такой смешанной группе имеет свои преимущества для каждой категории слушателей. Предприниматели делятся отработанными вариантами решения проблем, студенты предлагают новые идеи, а старшее поколение прогнозирует возможные факторы риска. «Мне нравится работать со студентами, потому что у них “свежий взгляд” и они готовы принять правила игры в той сфере, в которую они приходят. Они не спрашивают, как обойти те или иные буквы закона, а стремятся научиться делать правильно, грамотно выстраивать свой бизнес, ― отметила Ирина Оленбергер, бизнес-тренер программы ScaleUp. ― К сожалению, раньше подобных курсов не было и действующие сегодня игроки рынка многое прошли на своем опыте и переучиваться, даже при видимой перспективе и очевидной необходимости, им бывает сложно. Как следствие, количество предприятий малого и среднего бизнеса сокращается. Я нередко сталкиваюсь с тем, что предприниматели, в отсутствие своего бухгалтера, не могут дать ответ на вопрос о прибыли. На 16-часовом интерактивном курсе мы на реальных кейсах показываем, какую роль в развитии бизнеса играет наличие у владельца базовых навыков финансового учета и стратегического планирования». Программа «Повышение уровня финансовой грамотности и обучение основам ведения бизнеса» составлена на базе учебных модулей программы акселерации ScaleUp, отобранных Министерством инвестиций и инноваций и АНО «Агентство инвестиционного развития Московской области» для проведения курса. Все слушатели получили сертификат об успешном прохождении курса.

Она реализуется в мире с 2016 года. В России её оператором выступает ООО «Центр предпринимательства» через широкую партнерскую сеть. МТПП на регулярной основе проводит на своей площадке мероприятия в рамках этой программы. Представитель Центра предпринимательства Анастасия Куликова поблагодарила МТПП за ежемесячную организацию питч-сессий и поделилась ближайшими планами. В частности, она пригласила всех желающих принять участие во Всемирной неделе предпринимательства, которая пройдет с 12 по 18 ноября. Традиционно Московская ТПП пригласила к участию в сессии экспертов и инвесторов для презентации стартап-проектов, направленных на развитие экономики города. О формате мероприятия рассказал вице-президент МТПП Артём Далевич: «на питч проекта отводится 6 минут, за которые авторы должны раскрыть его суть, а также обозначить свой запрос. После каждого выступления отраслевые эксперты и потенциальные инвесторы разберут сильные и слабые стороны проектов и дадут свои советы» . Управляющий партнер/CEO компании HIC Capital Group LLC Николай Персиянов, традиционной выступающий модератором на мероприятиях в рамках программы «Startup Huddle» в Палате, выразил надежду, что сессия будет «энергичной», потому что «на ней представлены диверсифицированные проекты, связанные, в том числе с экологией» . На этот раз состоялась презентация четырех проектов. Открыл сессию проект IMAGIN – это агрегатор фэшн-магазинов с сильной рекомендательной системой стиля по изображению лица и типу фигуры на основе машинного обучения и нейронных сетей. Как рассказал автор идеи Павел Прояев, интернет-торговля сейчас показывает серьезный рост, при этом пользователи сталкиваются с проблемами при подборе одежды. Возникла идея помочь покупателю составить готовый образ с его визуализацией в зависимости от геометрии лица, цветотипа и особенностей фигуры. Сейчас команда ищет бизнес-партнеров, фэшн-площадки, а также заинтересована в инвестициях в объеме 22 млн. рублей. Расчетный срок окупаемости составляет 15 месяцев. Инвестору предлагается доля в прибыли в размере 15% (либо возврат инвестиций). По мнению экспертов, проект пока еще «сырой» и, в первую очередь, разработчикам необходимо изучить конкурентов, а также заняться поисками стратегических партнеров в сфере В2В. При этом, по мнению эксперта Андрея Мисюры, у проекта есть большой потенциал для работы со стилистами. Следующий проект представил Роман Кузьмин,­ СЕО проекта GameValues, который представляет собой единую платформу, объединяющую более 220 игр, с возможностью купли-продажи игровых ценностей и услуг между игроками. «Сейчас средний чек нашего продукта составляет около 300 рублей, а у наших конкурентов ­– 13 долларов» . Аудитория проекта – геймеры в возрасте от 13 до 45 лет. Сейчас локализация проекта – Россия, но есть планы по выходу через полгода на рынки стран СНГ, Европы и США. В проект вложено 4 млн «ангельских» денег и еще 700 тысяч вложили авторы проекта. Для развития требуется 21,7 млн рублей инвестиций на маркетинг, разработку мобильного приложения, ФОТ, развитие партнерской сети и безопасность. При этом Роман Кузьмин отметил, что рынок киберспорта является перспективным и показывает стабильный рост на 10-15% ежегодно. Эксперты признали проект перспективным, даже несмотря на то, что, как сказал Артем Далевич, «об уникальности здесь речь не идет». При этом, специалисты наметили основные шаги, которые нужно сделать проекту для того, чтобы двигаться дальше. Затем был рассмотрен проект, разработанный Всероссийским обществом изобретателей и рационализаторов (ВОИР) и представляющий собой устройство для смятия пластиковых бутылок. Как рассказал докладчик, советник ЦС ВОИР Юрий Чашков,­ устройство запатентовано. «Проблема пластиковых бутылок существует во всем мире» , ­заявил спикер. Только в Москве и области существуют 150 тысяч площадок для сбора бутылок, на которых стоят объявления с просьбой сминать бутылки, но при этом 95-98% бутылок выбрасываются в некомпактном виде. Предложенное устройство размещается около проволочного контейнера; бутылка (от 5-литровой до 500-миллилитровой) помещается туда, нажатием ноги на педаль сжимается в 3-4 раза, после чего попадает внутрь. Себестоимость одного изделия примерно 1,5 тысячи рублей, а реализовать его можно по цене примерно на тысячу дороже. Из-за уменьшения объема, количество рейсов, необходимых для вывоза вторсырья, сокращается в 3-4 раза, что только на экономии топлива дает хороший выигрыш. По приблизительным оценкам, мировой рынок смятия бутылок составляет около 4 млрд долларов, и за три года можно достигнуть уровня доходов в 2 млрд рублей. Для привлечения 1,5 тысяч клиентов и тестирование устройства необходимо 500 тысяч рублей. Как заявил докладчик, в проекте оказались не заинтересованы ни крупнейшая компания, занимающаяся вывозом раздельного мусора в Москве, ни РЭО (Российский экологический оператор). По мнению экспертов, проект может быть востребован, например в Удмуртии, где вопросам раздельного мусора уделяется серьезное внимание. Также, по мнению Артёма Далевича, это устройство могут использовать крупные корпорации в качестве социального проекта (корпоративная социальная ответственность). Последним в этот день был проект Eats.World – платформа для приёма платежей и организации доставки. Как рассказала его основатель и СЕО Наталья Яковлева, сейчас компании стали сильно зависеть от агрегаторов, а доставка товаров все чаще оказывается дорогой и некачественной. Поэтому наибольшие перспективы сейчас у бесшовного (омниканального шоппинга). « Современный потребитель заинтересован в разнообразии способов доставки и способов платежей. Он хочет это делать просто, в один клик» , - заявила автор проекта. Он ориентирован на малый и средний бизнес, в основном на сектор HoReCa, интернет-торговлю и предпринимателей, которые продают свой товар через соцсети: «Мы предлагаем «коробочные решения», при которых предприятие может организовывать прием платежей и доставку посредством заключения одного договора» . Прямых конкурентов, по словам Натальи Яковлевой сейчас у них нет. Косвенными же являются банки, агрегаторы, платежные системы. Однако все они не предоставляют всей полноты услуг потребителю. Основной запрос: поиск стратегического партнера, который готов вложить 14 млн рублей для масштабирования компании. Эксперты задали множество вопросов докладчику, отметив, что презентацию необходимо доработать. После того, как были заданы уточняющие вопросы, стало понятно, что проект интересный, перспективный, и не требующий настолько больших вложений. Автор проекта получила советы по совершенствованию презентации, а также по основным направлениям развития бизнеса.

Организатором данного события выступил проект Masterboards.ru при поддержке Центра предпринимательства. Модератором SH стал основатель проекта Masterboards.ru и член Управляющего совета Молодёжной финансовой лиги Николай Персиянов. Соорганизатором проекта выступил Денис Верюшкин, операционный директор Блока по отбору и развитию членов МФЛ. Формат события предполагает выступление 4-х стартапов. В виду ограничительных мер, связанных с коронавирусной инфекцией, к выступлению были приглашены 3 стартапа разных стадий, а часть экспертов была подключена через платформу ZOOM. В экспертный совет вошли представители разных направлений как корпоративной, так и предпринимательской среды. Среди них: Александр Вальцев (SF Education), Игорь Добровольский (Chapay Hub), Василий Кузнецов (IBCG), Искандар Рахматов (Zamwell, Largo Winch), Павел Соловьев (ООО «Кванториум», проект InBonds), Илья Солодкий (APEX Consulting Group), Родион Цалкин (ОАО «Красцветмет»), Андрей Якушин (IRIS), Дмитрий Ягодкин (эксперт по инвестиционной привлекательности и региональным институтам развития) и др. В рамках питч-сессии были представлены 3 проекта. Открыл Startup Huddle Александр Бенедиктов, презентовав «экосистему для начинающих инвесторов и предпринимателей» Smile Finance. Проект представляет собой платформу, объединяющую авторитетные компании-участников рынка ценных бумаг. Это простой и доступный портал для тех, кто планирует сделать первые шаги в мире инвестиций, а также новый подход к построению сообществ инвесторов и предпринимателей, позволяющий противодействовать мошенничеству в данном сегменте. О том, почему важно хранить чеки и как это делать правильно, рассказал Аскар Исхаков, руководитель проекта Dora.Team — приложение для хранения гарантийных талонов и мониторинга сроков. Кредо проекта «Самая плохая бумажка лучше самой хорошей памяти». Dora — новый способ взаимодействия с клиентами для компаний, а для физических лиц — возможность контролировать гарантийный сроки и наступление гарантийных случаев. Алексей Санников, технический директор EmotionExpert, рассказал о системе прогнозирования эмоционального выгорания сотрудников по социальным сетям на основе использования алгоритмов искусственного интеллекта. Эксперты и зрители смогли протестировать алгоритмы в Telegram чат-боте проекта на основе id ВКонтакте. Бот выдает 1 из 3 результатов: - выгорел; - не выгорел; - недостаточно данных, профиль закрыт. По окончании питч-сессии участники приняли участие в нетворкинге, где смогли в неформальной обстановке пообщаться с экспертным советом, обменяться контактами и поужинать. Следующая сессия в формате Startup Huddle состоится через неделю, 18 ноября .

Глобальное событие пройдет с 16 по 22 ноября 2020 года одновременно в более 180 странах мира. «Всемирная неделя предпринимательства в России пройдет в 13й раз, в 9й  ― при поддержке Минэкономразвития России. Каждый год она охватывает более 10 млн человек по всему миру, ― отметил Денис Дидковский, генеральный директор ООО «Центр предпринимательства». ― На протяжении недели будут проходить  мероприятия не только для представителей малого и среднего предпринимательства, банков и корпораций, но также для стартапов, начинающих и будущих предпринимателей. От лица Центра предпринимательства, главного организатора Всемирной недели предпринимательства в России, приглашаю представителей регионов, муниципалитетов, а также предпринимательского сообщества принять участие в одном из наиболее масштабных проектов по развитию предпринимательских экосистем». За свою 13-летнюю историю проект послужил стартом для создания новых площадок для бизнеса, вдохновил тысячи предпринимателей в России и в мире к основанию собственных компаний, их масштабированию. Проведение Всемирной недели предпринимательства способствует повышению мотивации и готовности российских граждан к практической предпринимательской деятельности, решению вопросов занятости, развитию конкурентоспособности и поиска себя в новых экономических реалиях, раскрытию инновационного потенциала страны. В России ВНП проходит с момента запуска этой инициативы в мире. Несколько лет подряд деятельность Центра предпринимательства была отмечена почетными наградами от глобального организатора Недели – Всемирной предпринимательской сети (Global Entrepreneurship Network, GEN): в 2008 - Champion Catalyzer Award, в 2011 - Compass Award GEW, в 2013 - Compass Award GEW. В 2019 году, благодаря поддержке Минэкономразвития РФ, к масштабному международному проекту подключились более 62 регионов России, было проведено более 500 мероприятий, объединивших около 253 000 человек. Так, например, в Санкт-Петербурге наряду с отраслевыми сессиями по молодежному предпринимательству, инвестициям и различным отраслям бизнеса, были проведены практические занятия для подростков 14-17 лет. В Белокурихе прошел ежегодный Слет сельской молодежи Сибирского федерального округа «Территория развития: Сибирь», объединив 300 инициативных молодых людей, у которых есть идеи по развитию и укреплению сельской экономики. 6-й Воронежский форум предпринимателей собрал более 3000 владельцев и управленцев малого, среднего и крупного бизнеса, маркетологов, представителей власти и общественных организаций в сфере предпринимательства. В 2020 г. Центр Предпринимательства планирует вместе с регионами, муниципалитетами, общественными организациями провести серию мероприятий по популяризации предпринимательства и предпринимательской инициативы,  организовать прямые трансляции с организаторами и участниками ВНП в других странах мира.

В коммюнике организации, представляющие молодых предпринимателей мира, призвали мировых лидеров занять прочную позицию в поддержке свободной торговли, качественного образования и международной мобильности для молодежи, а также еще раз подчеркнули важность международного сотрудничества для мирового экономического роста и процветания. «В прошлом году вводилось все большее число мер, которые представляют серьезную угрозу для экономически свободного мира, который нужен для того чтобы предприниматели могли создавать благосостояние и изменять наши общества к лучшему» , – сказал Бруно Сангинетти, председатель управляющего комитета Альянса молодых предпринимателей G20 и представитель организации, принимавшей в этом году ежегодный Саммит молодых предпринимателей G20. « Единственный способ ответа на тревожные тенденции – совместная работа по созданию мира, в котором мы как молодые предприниматели нуждаемся, – сказал Сангинетти, – именно поэтому мы, как предприниматели и создатели сообщества, должны высказывать свою точку зрения ».

Сотни молодых предпринимателей мира собрались в столице Аргентины, чтобы учиться, устанавливать связи и привлечь внимание правительств к новым идеям и подходам. Саммит завершился подписанием коммюнике, в котором подчеркивается важность международного сотрудничества для мирового экономического роста и процветания. «Единственный способ ответа на тревожные тенденции - совместная работа по созданию мира, в котором мы как молодые предприниматели нуждаемся, - сказал Сангинетти, - именно поэтому мы как предприниматели и создатели сообщества должны высказывать свою точку зрения». Саммит, организованный аргентинской национальной бизнес-ассоциацией CAME Joven, привлек ведущих предпринимателей и докладчиков из более чем 20 стран. Альянс молодых предпринимателей «Группы двадцати» (G20 YEA) - это глобальная сеть молодых предпринимателей и организаций, которые их поддерживают. Каждый год перед саммитом лидеров G20, Альянс проводит Саммит молодых предпринимателей, с тем чтобы содействовать в установлении новых деловых связей и обмене опытом в создании динамичных компаний, способствовать расширению диалога между ключевыми участниками предпринимательского сообщества на местном, национальном и международном уровнях. Альянс был официально создан на саммите молодых предпринимателей G20 в Торонто (Канада) в 2010 году и ежегодно проводит саммиты для вовлечения лидеров G20.

Startup Huddle – это международная программа, нацеленная на образование, развитие и сплочение предпринимательских сообществ посредством привлечения профильных экспертов и потенциальных инвесторов к решению вопросов, стоящих перед начинающими предпринимателями. «Мы регулярно собираемся на такие встречи, чтобы посмотреть несколько презентаций инновационных проектов, которые зачастую находятся в поиске финансирования. Наши встречи проходят очень эффективно – после многих из них завязываются полезные знакомства с экспертами. Предложения об инвестициях приходят, к сожалению, не всегда, но тем не менее проекты получают дополнительное освещение, включаются в каталоги – например, все сегодняшние проекты мы рады будем видеть в Каталоге инвестиционных проектов МТПП» , – сообщил участникам, открывая питч-сессию, вице-президент МТПП Артем Далевич. Модератор мероприятия – управляющий партнер HIC Capital Group, член Управляющего совета Молодежной финансовой лиги Николай Персиянов познакомил участников, экспертов и слушателей с форматом проведения питч-сессии. Основатель стартап-инкубатора Александр Махнёв представил первый проект под названием «Платформа организации ваших платных подписок 2starsinc», действующий под лозунгом «Занимайтесь творчеством, а монетизацией займемся мы». Спикер объяснил, что клиент сам назначает стоимость подписки в своем личном кабинете; показал, как выглядит страница подписки; рассказал, как с помощью творческого монетизатора, имеющегося на сайте, рассчитать стоимость подписки и число оформивших ее. По словам Александра Махнёва, представленный проект является аналогом Patreon – известного европейского сервиса платной подписки на контент, доказавшего свою успешность. «Наш проект “заточен” под блогеров» , – объяснил он. По расчетам, число блогеров, которым может быть интересна платная подписка, превышает в России 5 млн. человек. Основатель компании Corp.bank Александр Гришин представил собравшимся второй проект – мультибанк для корпоративного казначейства (все банки в Едином окне ERP). По его словам, платежи через клиент-банки в России составляют около $1,8 трлн в год. Эффект от банковских API в нашей стране хотят получить более 700 холдингов и более 1 тыс. средних компаний – между тем самостоятельно подключить API банка могут менее 1% компаний. Предложение в мире увеличивается – сегодня Open API в своих банках имеют 87% стран. Спикер объяснил, как работает Corp.bank, раскрыв его бизнес-модель. «Мы неплохо растем, – сказал он . – Проект запущен в 2019 г., и сейчас мы имеем около 30 клиентов» . По его словам, компания встроена в ERP-систему и постоянно организует вебинары, на которых делится своим опытом. Он также рассказал о команде, работающей над проектом, ближайших планах, в частности, запуске «пилотов» с участием банков и корпораций, и изучении международного рынка. Елена Сахарова провела питч-презентацию проекта SafetyVR (обучение производственным навыкам и безопасному выполнению работ). По данным Минтруда, объяснила она, количество случаев тяжелого травматизма составляет около 4,5 тыс. в год, из них 68% происходит по вине людей. Материальный ущерб от неверных действий персонала оценивается в сотни миллионов рублей, а текучесть рабочих кадров «сводит на нет» все затраты на переподготовку персонала. Обучение на физических тренажерах для предприятий крайне дорого, а традиционный инструктаж зачастую неэффективен. Она подробно описала преимущества проекта SafetyVR. « Мы делаем симуляторы виртуальной реальности, воспроизводим в них рабочие процессы, имитируем и оборудование, и окружение – и помогаем людям выработать навыки безопасного поведения» , – объяснила спикер. По ее словам, прохождение тренинга в шлеме виртуальной реальности значительно сокращает риски последующего травматизма. Спикер познакомила слушателей с нюансами предлагаемой методики, различные этапы которой можно комбинировать или использовать по отдельности. Проект предназначен для промышленных предприятий и учебных центров. По различным оценкам, тренировка в виртуальном шлеме на 92% эффективнее традиционного теоретического инструктажа, сообщила Елена Сахарова, поскольку позволяет человеку полностью сконцентрироваться на обучении, не отвлекаясь на посторонние факторы. Эксперты активно участвовали в обсуждении, задавали спикерам вопросы, рекомендовали различные варианты совершенствования и продвижения проектов. В заключение мероприятия его организаторы сообщили, что МТПП дарит всем спикерам ваучер на аналитику – предъявив его, можно будет пройти экспресс-диагностику своего проекта и получить бесплатную консультацию по развитию бизнеса у специалистов Департамента цифрового развития, инноваций и инвестиций.

Модератор мероприятия, управляющий партнер HIC Capital Group, член Управляющего совета Молодёжной финансовой лиги Николай Персиянов напомнил участникам, что формат SH предполагает 6-минутное выступление, после которого участники формулируют запрос к экспертам. Затем в течение 20 минут приглашенные эксперты и инвесторы дают обратную связь стартапу и оказывают помощь в решении озвученной проблемы. Во вступительном слове генеральный директор ООО «Центр предпринимательства» Денис Дидковский отметил: «Мы в формате Startup Huddle уходим от критики - конструктивной ли, нет ли. По сути, мы хотим, чтобы наши партнёрские стартапы здесь, на площадке, находили бы помощь именно в виде предпринимательских контактов. Как в плоскости внедрения, так и плоскости инвестиций. Это площадка для налаживания деловых контактов» . Первым с презентацией выступил генеральный директор ООО «Рэй Консалтинг» Николай Шилкин. Он представил проект AYCON EXIM DOX «Автоматизация экспортно-импортного документооборота». Проект призван существенно сократить издержки на высокооплачиваемых специалистов. «Наше решение EXIM DOX позволяет формировать и подписывать внешнеторговые документы, подчинённые любому праву и составленные на любом языке, быстро, просто и недорого» , - коротко охарактеризовал проект Николай Шилкин. Алан Хадиков выступил с питч-презентацией «3K TEAM – Источник питания длительного действия и сервис зарядки для космических аппаратов». Одной из важнейших проблем, которые существуют сегодня в освоении космоса, он назвал отсутствие надёжного и мощного источника энергии с длительным сроком службы. «Наше решение со временем полностью заменит солнечные панели и изменит всю концепцию создания космических аппаратов» , - заявил Алан Хадиков. Он добавил, что было найдено оптимальное техническое решение, которое использует уже существующие и проверенные технологии. «Применение наших ноу-хау позволило создать систему энергоснабжения с длительным сроком работы – более 100 лет. Система надёжна и износостойка за счёт отсутствия подвижных частей конструкции и полностью независима от внешних источников, таких, как солнечный свет» , - добавил спикер. Анастасия Анисова представила проект «Аптечка – Вендинг с лекарствами». Стартап предлагает создать сеть медицинских вендинговых автоматов. Предполагается, что это будет сервис с удобной системой, который позволит продавать безрецептурные лекарства поштучно. Даниил Грибов выступил с питч-презентацией «Week – мобильное приложение для прямых трансляций, фотографий и коротких видео». Он рассказал о новом мобильном сервисе, в котором «собран весь социальный, медийный контент про любую компанию, про любую организацию – неважно какого масштаба». В приложение встроены механизм прямых трансляций и маркетплейс совместных покупок. Для предпринимателей – это возможность размещения контента, поиска сотрудников и сокращение издержек на рекламу. Потребитель же сможет делать совместные покупки со скидками и получать персональные предложения. Эксперты заинтересованно обсуждали каждый проект и давали по нему свои рекомендации.

Открыл сессию вице-президент МТПП Артём Далевич, который напомнил, что Startup Huddle – это формат, «на котором основатели, руководители Startup проектов и новых инновационных разработок презентуют свои идеи, проекты и текущие бизнесы. В ответ они получают экспертную оценку и поддержку от членов палаты, партнёров ООО «Центр предпринимательства» . Модератор мероприятия Николай Персиянов, управляющий партнер HIC Capital Capital, член Управляющего совета Молодёжной финансовой лиги рассказал участникам мероприятия о формате его проведения и правилах. На презентацию выделяется 10 минут, затем 20 минут идёт обсуждение проекта. Генеральный директор ООО «Центр предпринимательства» Денис Дидковский пояснил: «Проект наш для помощи стартапам. Соответственно и площадка работает как площадка деловых контактов, где эксперты рассматривают стартапы и тут же делают какие-то предложения» . Шухрат Хасанов выступил с презентацией «ИНСТАТЕКА – Помощь для владельцев недвижимости». Инстатека – это платформа для реализации недвижимости в первую очередь через ипотеку. Принцип заключается в том, что это единый канал коммуникации для всех участников сделки: партнёров, банков, страховых и оценочных компаний. Ипотечная платформа Инстатека позволяет увеличить одобряемость сделки в три раза и сократить время выхода на сделку с 30 до 10 дней. Об Аппарате «MurQ» для экстренной помощи при менструальной боли рассказала Мария Филатова. По словам Марии, проблема есть у каждого четвертого жителя планеты – каждая десятая женщина пропускает работу из-за регулярных болей. Поэтому проект может считаться не только медицинским, но социально актуальным. Решение, которое предлагает Мари Филатова, – аппарат «MurQ». При возникновении боли достаточно приложить его к животу. Проходят спазм, боль прекращается почти сразу. Результаты исследований показали, что полностью боль прошла почти у 90% женщин. А легче стало абсолютно всем. Минимальное время до достижения полного обезболивания составило 3 минуты. Корсаков Андрей выступил с презентацией «Board – Платформа для онлайн-занятий». Эта платформа помогает репетиторам зарабатывать больше. На ней можно проводить онлайн занятия, выстраивать систему обратной связи с родителями, принимать от них платежи, а также получать поддержку сообщества. Платформа позволяет писать, рисовать, прикреплять изображения, формулы. За полгода работы сервиса удалось привлечь на платформу 10 тысяч педагогов. В ходе презентации проектов предприниматели получили их экспертную оценку и помощь в решении озвученных вопросов.

Startup Huddle (SH) – это международная программа, нацеленная на образование, развитие и сплочение предпринимательских сообществ; один из продуктов Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN). «Благодаря подобным питч-сессиям мы накапливаем опыт, собираем базу проектов, продвигаем их в инвестиционном сообществе» , – отметил, открывая мероприятие, вице-президент МТПП Артем Далевич. Он привел свежий пример – по запросу корпоративного акселератора МТS StartUp Hub сотрудниками департамента были подобраны несколько проектов, ранее презентованных на питч-сессиях. «Мы направили всю информацию, за которую МТS Hub были очень благодарны – они надеются, что мы и дальше будем поставлять интересные проекты под их запросы» , – рассказал Артем Далевич. «С ноября 2020 года совместно с МТПП мы провели более 25 питч-сессий , – сообщил управляющий партнер/СЕО HIC Capital Group Николай Персиянов. – Особенность формата Startup Huddle состоит в том, что проект презентуется, затем формулируется запрос к экспертам, после чего в течение 20 минут дается обратная связь. Это своего рода мастермайнд для стартапов, который позволяет достичь синергетического эффекта и действительно приводит к определенным результатам». Советник ЦС ВОИР по водному транспорту Юрий Чашков представил первый проект – автономную напорную систему пожаротушения («АНСП»). «В новых городах, где много спальных районов и предприятий с огнеопасными производствами, пожары происходят почти ежедневно. До приезда пожарных все успевает сгореть», – объяснил спикер и далее описал устройство и принцип действия АСНП, основу которого составляет напорный резервуар с водой под давлением герметичного поршня. Устройство (башня 24 м высотой и 2,5 м в диаметре стоимостью 600 тыс. руб.) способно находиться в дежурном режиме неограниченное время без потребления электроэнергии или напора воды извне и тушить пожар в течение 30 минут до прибытия пожарных. По словам Юрия Чашкова, с помощью АСНП можно тушить пожары в исторических центрах с узкими улицами; спальных районах с высокоэтажной застройкой; на складах с легковоспламеняющимися материалами; на нефтеперерабатывающих заводах, в нефтехранилищах и т.д. CEO Ксения Соломатина рассказала о проекте «Карьерно-образовательные траектории для студентов и взрослых – сервис по проектированию глобальной карьеры». «Цель нашего проекта в том, чтобы студенты по окончании вуза были готовы к работе и компаниям не приходилось бы доучивать их или переучивать» , – объяснила спикер. По ее словам, между вузами и компаниями существует разрыв: компании зачастую не информируют вузы о том, специалисты с какими компетенциями понадобятся им через несколько лет, а преподаватели вузов, соответственно, не знают, какие навыки нужны их студентам. «В качестве решения мы предлагаем компаниям возможность документального подтверждения имеющихся у студентов навыков и уровня коммуникации без необходимости проведения дополнительного тестирования, доучивания и переучивания, – рассказала Ксения Соломатина. – В свою очередь, вузам мы даем возможность своевременно оптимизировать свои учебные программы и сохранять за собой таким образом рыночную нишу по подготовке профессионалов на рынке труда». Она описала, как работает презентуемый сервис. Его финальным продуктом является цифровое портфолио, показывающее, какими навыками студент реально владеет. По словам спикера, через сервис уже прошло более 500 тыс. пользователей. Она описала конкурентные преимущества проекта, емкость рынка и предложения для партнеров. СЕО и сооснователь проекта Александр Гуляев представил собравшимся Сервис mythe.ru — инвестиции в систему управленческого учета для оцифровки, контроля и масштабирования бизнеса при помощи собственной платформы и торговой площадки, помогающей привлекать инвестиции, продавать бизнес или франшизу. Проект позволяет урегулировать пять аспектов любого бизнеса: выстроить контроль и управление сотрудниками; скорректировать спрос, доходность, сезонность продукции; упорядочить работу с клиентами (заявки, источники, воронки, продажи); наладить управление финансами и их планирование; привлечь инвестиции для масштабирования компании. Сервис помогает компании правильно распоряжаться деньгами, отслеживать все расходы и зачисления. По словам спикера, система уже работает и привлекает пользователей. Он рассказал, какие средства ищет команда и за какой срок проект должен окупиться. Приглашенные эксперты детально оценили достоинства, слабые стороны и перспективы каждого проекта и дали рекомендации по их дальнейшему продвижению.

Владельцы парикмахерских и табачных домов, производители упаковки и настольных игр, фрилансеры и многие другие собрались вместе для рассмотрения кейсов друг друга и обмена мнениями по вопросам поиска новых решений для развития бизнеса. Участница встречи Татьяна Муранова уже 7 лет занимается ресторанным бизнесом. Она рассказала собравшимся об особенностях этой сферы, о клиентских ожиданиях и качестве обслуживания, а также об основных сложностях, с которыми чаще всего сталкиваются все рестораторы. «Я работаю по франшизе ресторанной сети «Грузинские каникулы», имеющей 48 точек в Москве и области. Свою главную задачу я вижу в обеспечении высокого уровня сервиса, что мы стараемся достигать посредством тщательного подбора персонала, ― поделилась Татьяна Муранова. ― Наши официанты проходят специальное обучение и стажировку прежде чем приступить к основной работе. Однако, важно учесть, что в современном мире требования к официантом возросли: от них ожидают и умение проконсультировать по меню с уточнением калорийности блюд, и готовность настроить приложение на устройстве клиента для предоставления скидки, и еще массу прочего. К сожалению, не все справляются с нагрузкой и поэтому взрастить своего «идеального» официанта ― это настоящая задача. На рынке серьезный недостаток качественных кадров». Предприниматели поделились своими наблюдениями о качестве обслуживания в ресторанах города, а также обсудили возможность привлечения новых гостей и повышения лояльности постоянных клиентов посредством социальных сетей и работы с блогерами. Ведущая различных мероприятий в Подольске и популярный блогер Ольга Солнечная поддержала тему продвижения бизнеса в социальных сетях и рассказала о преимуществах работы с лидерами мнений в интернете. Она также отметила заинтересованность во взаимодействии с другими предпринимателями города, обозначив важность организации полезных площадок для бизнес-диалога. Участники встречи сошлись во мнении, что площадки для местных сообществ должны создаваться с целью реализации предпринимательского потенциала. Бизнес-тренер Мария Земляк подчеркнула, что именно интерес к знакомству с лучшими практиками приводит предпринимателя к обретению единомышленников. Так, первостепенным должно быть стремление к развитию, а не внешние обстоятельства в виде наличия или отсутствия площадки.

Саммит G20 YEA – это ведущее международное мероприятие для молодых предпринимателей, ежегодно собирающее в стране-председателе «Большой Двадцатки» более 400 предпринимателей из стран G20. Саммит Альянса молодых предпринимателей «Большой Двадцатки» проводится ежегодно, начиная с 2010 года, с целью развития международного делового сотрудничества и продвижения диалога по ключевым аспектам развития предпринимательства и стимулирования экономического роста. В 2013 году Summit G20 YEA проходил в России, и его организатором выступал ООО «Центр Предпринимательства», который является сооснователем Саммита G20 YEA и активно сотрудничает с «Деловой двадцаткой» на протяжении уже 9 лет. Тема саммита G20 YEA в 2019 году в Японии – «Imagination Economy - For Sustainable Future. Ценность для участников саммита представляет, прежде всего, нетворкинг, неформальное общение с коллегами-предпринимателями из стран «Большой Двадцатки» в ходе мероприятия. Участие в саммите такого масштаба позволяет участникам первыми познакомиться с актуальными отраслевыми тенденциями, новыми бизнес-моделями, наладить международные контакты и найти потенциальных инвесторов, поставщиков, клиентов или партнеров, встретить единомышленников, выработать новые идеи. В российской делегации могут принять участие российские предприниматели (собственники, учредители, соучредители, руководители компаний или организаций), до 40 лет, стремящиеся к расширению международных контактов для развития бизнеса, интересующиеся обсуждением глобальной повестки развития предпринимательства. Рабочим языком Саммита является английский язык. Прием заявок на участие в российской делегации проводится до 15 апреля 2019 года.

В пресс-конференции в Москве участвовали: Седов Виктор Михайлович – генеральный директор ООО «Центр Предпринимательства»; Арсланова Милена Тахировна – директор Департамента инвестиционной политики Министра экономического развития РФ; Корочкин Владислав Леонтьевич – первый вице-президент «ОПОРЫ РОССИИ» по экспертно-аналитической деятельности; Зорин Анатолий Александрович – директор ФГБУ «Российский центр содействия молодежного предпринимательства». Пресс-конференция в ТАСС проходила в формате телемоста с Санкт-Петербургом, откуда на связь вышел Петровичев Дмитрий Александрович – Член Президиума – Управляющий, Бюро по защите прав предпринимателей и инвесторов при «ОПОРЕ РОССИИ». «В этом году правительство так точечно уделило внимание популяризации предпринимательства. Мер поддержки предпринимательства было много, именно в рамках национального проекта, они были все рассмотрены, и лучшие региональные практики сформированы в 5-ти федеральных проектах. И как раз федеральный проект по популяризации стал тем проектом, стал отличным дополнением. Почему именно популяризация? В регионах программ очень много, но предприниматели не всегда осведомлены об этом и не всегда пользуются. В тоже время мы понимаем, насколько необходима точечная работа разными группами предпринимателей, находить к каждой свой индивидуальный подход. Мы фокусируем свое внимание не только на активной части населения, преимущественно это молодые люди до 35 лет, кто открывает бизнес. Но это также пенсионеры, школьники. И главная наша задача через все наши проекты – это хотя бы немного изменить мировоззрение в отношении предпринимателей. Также при работе мы видим большую роль регионов» , – говорит Арсланова Милена Тахировна, директор Департамента инвестиционной политики и развития предпринимательства. Задачи Всемирной недели предпринимательства – привлечь внимание всех участников к развитию экосистемы предпринимательства и предпринимательской культуры в стране путем организации мероприятий и активностей, связанных с инновациями и предпринимательством в даты Недели. В Неделе участвуют организации, которые проводят мероприятия в сфере поддержки предпринимательства и развития малого и среднего бизнеса, инвестиционные фонды, институты развития, государственные органы, инкубаторы и акселераторы, а также сами предприниматели – все они выступают организаторами-участниками ВНП в своих странах. Идея данной международной инициативы полностью соответствует задачам, поставленным Указом Президента Российской Федерации от 7 мая 2018 года № 204 «О национальных целях и стратегических задачах развития Российской Федерации на период до 2024 года». «Предприниматель — это главная движущая сила инноваций. Предприниматель — это экономический рост, рабочие места, это процветание и улучшение благосостояния. Поэтому проект так быстро развивается и находит такую широкую поддержку. В2007 году во Всемирной неделе предпринимательства участвовали 43 страны, а в 2018 году 170 стран мира. Россия участвует в этом проекте с первого года, все одиннадцать лет. Несколько лет подряд (в 2008 - Champion Catalyzer Award), 2011 - Compass Award GEW 2011, 2013 - Compass Award GEW 2013 и в этом 2018 году - Ecosystem Champion Award 2018) деятельность Центра предпринимательства (организатора Всемирной недели предпринимательства в России) за вклад в развитие экосистемы предпринимательства была отмечена почетными наградами от глобального организатора Недели – Global Entrepreneur Network GEN» ,— г оворит Виктор Седов, генеральный директор ООО «Центр Предпринимательства». Петровичев Дмитрий Александрович во время телемоста с Санкт-Петербургом рассказал о масштабе мероприятий в северной столице и форматах поддержки, которую оказывает местная ОПОРА предпринимателям в Санкт-Петербурге. В России Всемирная неделя предпринимательства стартовала в 2007 году по инициативе ООО «Центр Предпринимательства» и уже 7-й год проходит при поддержке Министерства экономического развития Российской Федерации. В прошлом 2017 году в разных городах России к проведению были заявлены более 250 мероприятий от 200 организаторов. Ожидается, что в этом 2018 году ВНП в России соберет по итогам реализации всех мероприятий около полумиллиона человек участвующих. Во время Всемирной недели предпринимательства 2018 Центр Предпринимательства проводит ежедневные прямые включения с организаторами GEW в 10 странах мира (Парагвай, Австралия, Индия, Непал, ЮАР, Бразилия, Болгария, Черногория, Бахрейн, Южная Корея и другие). Участники Недели поделятся друг с другом историями успеха, секретами работы и поддержки предпринимательства в регионе. Программа включений и ссылка на трансляцию: https://events.webinar.ru/cfe/gew18russia Чтобы подвести глобальные итоги Всемирной недели предпринимательства по всему миру, организаторы Недели из 175 стран соберутся 14-19 апреля 2019 года на Всемирный предпринимательский конгресс (Global Entrepreneurship Congress) в Бахрейне .

Первым выступил Даниил Орлов, представив проект Acur Lab-информационные чат боты в ТЦ: новый канал привлечения клиентов. Данный сервис - это ассистент-помощник, который автоматически подсказываем покупателю, где можно купить интересующий его товар, показывает рекламу по личным запросам и интересам, создает и анализирует информацию о скидках, товарах, магазинах и прочем. Предпринимательское сообщество порекомендовало обратить внимание на следующие аспекты: прописать бизнес модель, модель монетизации, выстроить ценностное предложение для арендатора ТЦ с обоснованием экономического эффекта от работы с ними; продумать стратегию компании в условиях пандемии/ смены покупательского поведения (люди стали активнее совершать покупки через онлайн); высказали опасение относительно защиты маржи. Вторым спикером стал основатель и руководитель компании «MultiSay», которая занимается автоматизацией клиентского обслуживания в мессенджерах, Максим Котов. SaaS решение с оплатой за подписчиков, которое позволяет решить следующие проблемы: отсутствие двухстороннего общения с клиентами; низкая клиентоориентированность и как следствие низкая лояльность; отсутствуют инструменты удержания и возврата и как следствие большой отток клиентов. Участники отметили инвестиционную перспективность данного проекта, однако при этом порекомендовали проверить гипотезу на больших цифрах и получить реальные данные по конверсии; в качестве спикера проекта выдвигать не IT специалиста, а маркетолога/менеджера по продажам.

На мероприятие были представлены два финских стартапа, которые планируют выйти на рынок Российской Федерации. Первым выступил Antti Tarakkam, представив проект bankify - это будущее финансовых приложений, выступающих в качестве платформы BtB для банковских и финансовых учреждений, которое повышает качество обслуживания клиентов. Bankify имеет готовые микро сервисы с открытым API и возможности искусственного интеллекта для поддержки любого финансового приложения с помощью персонализации, геймификации, социальных аспектов и анализа данных. Предпринимательское сообщество порекомендовало обратить внимание на следующие аспекты: подумать об изменение логотипа, в нем не прослеживается инновационность, подумать о позиционировании: выбрать B2B или В2С рынок. Два представителя предпринимательского сообщества готовы помочь стартапу выстроить продажи на финском и на английском оффлане, дать контакты на Российском рынке. Вторым спикером стал основатель и руководитель компании Norhern Pails (ZONE) - Jarno Voutilainen. Девайс для льда, который имеет универсальный беспроводной динамик, True Wireless Stereo (TWS) - развлекательный центр и подсветку. У предпринимательского сообщества был вопрос проекту: какой партнер нужен в России, какие каналы сбыта планируют использовать? Стартап предполагает работать через дистрибьютера. Экспертное сообщество порекомендовала в первую очередь защитить интеллектуальною собственность, причем сделать акцент на защиту объемных товарных знаков (колонка с емкостью и светильником). Следующая онлайн/оффлайн-встреча состоится 19 ноября в 18.00 по Мск.

Уникальность продукта: равномерное растворение в течение 12 месяцев единственный известный в мире саморасширяющийся периферический стент, который позволяет имплантировать в извитые сосуды с радиальной силой в 1 Н/см, как и у металлических аналогов одинаковая толщина страт как у NiTi стентов Предпринимательское сообщество однозначно отметило, что проект инвестиционно-привлекательный с сильной командой основателей. ⠀ О доставке горячего хлеба по подписке рассказал идейный вдохновитель и руководитель компании «и Хлеба» Игорь Суриков. Проект уже реализуется, при этом собственных пекарен у компании нет, выпечка хлеба производится подрядчиком. На данный момент количество подписчиков составляет около 270 человек со средним чеком 550 рублей. Эксперты посоветовали четко проработать бизнес-модель, сфокусировать внимание на логистике, создании устойчивой клиентской базы, а потом прорабатывать концепцию производства. Также компании рекомендовали выстроить ценностное предложение для клиента. Юлия Железнёва из компании «АС Смета» рассказала об автоматизированной цифровой платформе для открытого ценообразования в сфере строительных материалов и оборудования в сегменте В2В. Преимущества платформы: мониторинг актуальных цен онлайн формирование проекта и сметы загрузка спецификации проекта на площадку с автоматическим поиском необходимых позиций. Эксперты посчитали проект интересным, во время мероприятия уже был найден потенциальный партнёр проекта. ⠀ Завершил конференцию Дмитрий Новосельцев, руководитель и основатель проекта «D-start», представив экспертам двигатели сверхмалых космических аппаратов. На сегодняшний день еще нет двигателей для новых, перспективных, космических аппаратов фемто-класса. Продукт имеет преимущество - ряд технических решений на базе технологии кинетических реактивных двигателей. ⠀ Следующая онлайн-встреча Startup Huddle состоится 10 декабря в 18.00 по мск. ⠀ Если вы хотите стать участником встречи и представить свой проект, присылайте заявку на электронный адрес: soba.spb@gmail.com Возврат к списку Главная О Центре Направления деятельности Программы Центра Календарь мероприятий Фотогалерея Новости Контакты Наши контакты +7 (499) 344-79-27 Пн. – Пт.: с 9:00 до 18:00 Москва, ул. 1-я Тверская-Ямская, д. 23, стр. 1 contact@cfe.ru © 2021 ООО «Центр Предпринимательства» Мы в соцсетях Найти",

Первой выступила Ксения Пуляткина, представив проект SOTA, сервис для повышения качества здоровья сотрудников. Уже проведена работа по созданию бота, прописаны процессы взаимодействия между клиентом и исполнителем, налажен контроль за соблюдением качества работ. По словам Ксении Пуляткиной, внедрение данной платформы позволит снизить медицинские расходы на 3% – около 4,5 млрд. рублей в год. Среди принятых участником предложений экспертов было привлечение в команду продуктового менеджера. Вторым спикером стал основатель, идейный вдохновитель и руководитель компании «Buskerville» Алексей Самсонов. Мобильное приложение для граждан и гостей города позволяет разнообразить досуг за счет геймификации. Приложение позволяет в режиме реального времени смотреть все городские события, связанные с выступлением уличных артистов. На карте есть интерактивные точки, на которых артист может забронировать предполагаемое время выступления. Зритель таким же образом может поставить рейтинг артисту или мероприятию. Также приложение является информационным ресурсом, для ознакомления артистов и зрителей с правилами проведения таких мероприятий. Эксперты порекомендовали четко определить целевую аудиторию, понять на каком рынке они планируют работать, сделать сегментацию. Евгений Ангелуца рассказал о компании «Hato», платформе для аутсорсинга call-центров. Участники отметили инвестиционную перспективность данного проекта, однако при этом порекомендовали четче определить целевую аудиторию, сделать для нее предложение и протестировать гипотезы. Обсудили проблемы рынка, конкурентное преимущество продукта. Порекомендовали показать на конкретном примере, как платформа работает, чьи проблемы решает, на сколько данный подход востребован на рынке. В презентации донести до конечного пользователя информацию о том, сколько он может сэкономить и какие выгоды будут получены при размещении заказа на этой платформе. Завершил конференцию Игорь Киселев, руководитель и основатель проекта «Piligram», представляющий собой инструмент для создания историй из путешествий. Продукт имеет ряд преимуществ: возможность делиться своим опытом с другими пользователями; отображать пользовательские видео со всего мира; создавать яркие и необычные видеоролики из путешествий; накладывать музыку на свои видео в 2 клика. Эксперты вместе с руководителем компании обсудили конкурентные преимущества и порекомендовали продумать, как будет осуществляться защита маржи. Следующая онлайн-встреча состоится 22 октября.

Первым выступил Антон Катков, представив проект XO Analytics — аналитический онлайн-сервис. Данный сервис автоматически создает и анализирует комплексные аналитические бизнес-модели. Предпринимательское сообщество порекомендовало сформировать УТП, описать портрет клиента, разработать кейсы для российских инвесторов, пересмотреть оценку компании, зарегистрировать юридическое лицо. Вторым спикером стал основатель, идейный вдохновитель и руководитель компании Ucar Ильяс Тайценов. Ucar — это маркетплейс автомоек, работающий по модели Uber и оказывающий услуги через субподряд или аутсорсинг ресурсов. Ежемесячные объемы составляют 80 00 заказов, 20 000 авто, более 100 автомоек. Регионы покрытия: Москва, Санкт-Петербург, Сочи. Эксперты порекомендовали четко определить инвестора следующего раунда, выстроить ценностное предложение для клиента с обоснованием экономического эффекта от работы с ними. Роман Хорошев рассказал о компании JetLend, являющейся краудлендинговой платформой. По словам основателя, компания совершила технологический подрыв классического банкинга в сегменте МСБ — перенос банковской маржи на инвесторов. Принцип работы платформы: кредитование малого и среднего бизнеса напрямую через интернет-платформу физическими, юридическими лицами, институциональными инвесторами.  На сегодняшний день полностью автоматизирована система оценки рисков с использованием искусственного интеллекта, разработано и протестировано SAAS решение с крупной российской корпорацией, создан вторичный рынок займов, вся деятельность приведена в полное соответствие с 259-ФЗ, регулирующего деятельность инвестиционных платформ. Участники отметили инвестиционную перспективность данного проекта, однако порекомендовали более внимательно оценивать заявки от заемщиков малого бизнеса. Обсудили проблемы рынка, конкурентное преимущество проекта. Следующая онлайн-встреча состоится 22 октября в 18:00.

В рамках него 22 предпринимателя из разных сфер дискутировали и давали друг другу ценные рекомендации. «В Клуб вступают для обмена опытом, чтобы изучить кейсы друг друга, найти новые идеи и действенные решения для бизнеса, получить поддержку и, возможно, даже заключить партнерские соглашения, ― отметил Денис Дидковский, генеральный директор ООО «Центр предпринимательства». ― Это, в первую очередь, возможность быстро и эффективно при помощи членов Клуба и экспертов определить пути решения реальных задач, получить всестороннюю поддержку единомышленников и обзавестись новыми полезными деловыми контактами. Мы уделяем большое внимание формированию сообществ предпринимателей и намерены провести ряд заседаний Бизнес-клуба в городах Московской области. Подобные встречи способствуют развитию региональных предпринимательских экосистем». После знакомства членов Клуба слово взяли предприниматели Ольга Кацуба и Мария Земляк с докладом о стратегии поиска новых идей и решений для бизнеса и последующей их реализации. Выступление вызвало большой интерес у аудитории, участники делились своими историями успеха и дополняли методы друг друга. Затем Ольга и Мария представили собравшимся стратегию ведения сетевого бизнеса, а владелец ресторана Мигель Галуст поделился особенностями развития в этой сфере. В разборе кейсов приняла участие и бизнес-тренер Айсулу Маханова, предложив участникам методику по выстраиванию бизнес-процессов с точки зрения повышения эффективности продаж. Многие предприниматели отмечали, что часто сталкиваются с кадровыми проблемами: молодежь выставляет несоизмеримые с опытом требования к условиям обеспечения труда, а сотрудники после дорогостоящего обучения покидают компанию. Кроме того, члены Клуба обратили внимание на риск утечки интеллектуальной собственности и клиентских баз. В рамках тренинга Айсулу Маханова дала рекомендации по решению всех озвученных проблем, среди которых она отметила важность формирования четкого портрета нужного сотрудника перед рассмотрением соискателей, значение кадрового резерва, а также важность реализации мотивирующих программ для коллектива. Тем не менее, тренер отметила, что обновление кадров раз в 3-5 лет является естественным процессом, к которому нужно быть готовым.

Во встрече приняли участие 20 предпринимателей. Особое внимание было уделено вопросам финансового управления и проблеме взаимодействия с банками. Так, Павел Колосок, представитель группы компаний КПД, занимается строительством бревенчатых домов. Павел ведет предпринимательскую деятельность с 2008 года и является лидером бизнес-сообществ Москвы и области. На встрече он поделился историей развития своего бизнеса и обозначил сложности, с которыми сталкивался в диалогах с банковскими структурами. Ольга Блинова, эксперт по финансам, согласилась с тем, что ситуации с блокировками счета без ведомых причин у представителей бизнеса случаются. Она также пояснила, что «многие предприниматели сталкиваются с высокими процентными ставками по кредитам и прочими обстоятельствами, но важно принимать во внимание, что у банковских служащих есть соответствующие инструкции по выполнению своей работы. Поэтому следует ознакомиться с рейтингом банка, внимательно изучить положения договора, выбрать наиболее выгодные для себя условия и подстроиться». Самым юным участником заседания стала 19-летняя Анна Калинина, которая только планирует начать свое дело по созданию и продвижению сайтов и мобильных приложений. Сейчас девушка получает образование и изучает рынок. Свой первый заказ на создание сайта по строительству и продаже домов она получила на встрече от члена Клуба Павла Колосок. Хазова Юлия, председатель комитета женщин-предпринимателей, стала одним из наиболее опытных представителей бизнеса на собрании Клуба. С 2002 года она занимается организацией выставочной и экскурсионной деятельности, а также содержит картинную галерею и музей Лягушки (символ города Дмитров). Этому символу города Дмитров также посвящен ежегодный летний фестиваль, который Юлия всегда проводит. Также во время школьных каникул она принимает детей с 14 лет для обучения всем тонкостям профессии гида и предоставляет возможность заработать на проведении экскурсий. «Мне нравится то, что я делаю, я буквально этим живу, поэтому, наверное, несмотря на сложности многозадачной работы, всегда находятся силы, ― заметила Юлия Хазова. ― Для меня важно, чтобы о моем деле узнавали люди из всех уголков страны. Залог успеха в бизнесе мне видится в установлении связей с предпринимательским сообществом и в принесении пользы другим. Обе задачи решают встречи предпринимателей из разных сфер бизнеса в Клубе ScaleUp. Это реальный шанс заявить о себе и получить выгодные предложения по развитию своего дела». В заседании Бизнес-клуба также принял участие Николай Савин, реализующий стройматериалы и топливо для частного сектора. Его предложение заинтересовало двух владельцев загородных домов и прямо в рамках встречи были заключены договоры закупки материалов для отопления по оптовой цене. Проблему высокой комиссии банков за обналичивание денежных средств поднял молодой программист Фофанов Илья, который написал более 500 видеоуроков по программированию и имеет более 5000 учеников по всему миру. Шишкова Светлана, владелец магазина натуральной косметики, поделилась с собравшимися своей методикой ведения диалога с покупателями и получила рекомендации по привлечению новых клиентов и повышению лояльности. Предприниматели, успешно занимающиеся проведением тендеров по 44-ФЗ, поделились особенностями реализации проектов со всеми заинтересованными. Участники встречи договорились снова собраться 10 апреля для повышения финансовой грамотности и решения имеющихся сложностей по кредитным займам и определению выгодных условий. Центр предпринимательства привлечет к встрече представителей банка, которые ответят на все вопросы членов Бизнес-клуба ScaleUp.

Уверены, что этот проект позволит многим действующим игрокам рынка сделать новые шаги в развитии своего дела и придаст уверенности тем, кто только планировал начать предпринимательскую деятельность». В коворкинге «Старт» собрались владельцы различных спортивных секций, творческих школ (рисования и танцев) и развивающих детских центров, фитнес-клубов, а также магазинов ювелирных изделий и подарков ручной работы. В рамках курса предприниматели активно участвовали в дискуссиях по вопросам планирования бизнеса, обменивались опытом и делились своими представлениями о возможных проблемах в развитии дела, а также объединялись в группы для совместного разбора реальных кейсов и предлагали проверенные пути решения имеющихся сложностей. Таким образом, обучение отчасти способствовало формированию небольшого предпринимательского сообщества в городе. После занятий Зоя Панина, руководитель сети фитнес-клубов поделилась впечатлениями: «Я пропустила информацию о предстоящем обучении для предпринимателей и оказалась в этот день в коворкинге из-за назначенных переговоров с партнерами. Узнав про то, что в рамках реализации нацпроекта по предпринимательству проводится курс по основам ведения бизнеса, решила остаться и не пожалела! Ознакомилась со стратегией других участников, увидела со стороны свои ошибки, получила ценные рекомендации от бизнес-тренера и теперь лучше понимаю влияние грамотно выстроенной стратегии на развитие бизнеса». По завершении курса все слушатели получили сертификат о прохождении обучения по программе «Повышение уровня финансовой грамотности и обучение основам ведения бизнеса». * - Фотография предоставлена  телеканалом 360 Возврат к списку Главная О Центре Направления деятельности Программы Центра Календарь мероприятий Фотогалерея Новости Контакты Наши контакты +7 (499) 929-79-27 Пн. – Пт.: с 9:00 до 18:00 Москва, ул. 1-я Тверская-Ямская, д. 23, стр. 1 contact@cfe.ru © 2019 ООО «Центр Предпринимательства» Мы в соцсетях Найти",

Мероприятие провел Союз организаций бизнес-ангелов (СОБА), партнер Центра предпринимательства. Международная программа Startup Huddle разработана Всемирной предпринимательской сетью (GEN) и направлена на образование, развитие и сплочение предпринимательских сообществ. Программа постоянно совершенствуется в разных странах, но главная ее идея остается неизменной ― предоставить предпринимателю возможность задать вопрос экспертам и получить моментальную обратную связь. «Мы давно искали формат взаимодействия членов нашего Союза и стартапов, нацеленный на развитие проектов, которые обращаются к нам за инвестициями. Ведь чем лучше развивается проект, тем скорее он привлечет инвестиции. А наши инвесторы накопили большой опыт в создании успешных бизнесов и готовы им делиться. Также это помогает им разобраться в проекте задолго до принятия решения об инвестировании», ― говорит Луиза Александрова, директор по развитию СОБА. В рамках мероприятия в Санкт-Петербурге 4 предпринимателя провели короткую презентацию своего бизнеса, выделив его конкурентные преимущества и поделившись актуальными проблемами. Так, Алексей Тихомиров, владелец компании «Аквастаил», которая уже 11 лет на рынке занимается производством пузырьковых панелей отметил, что сейчас занимается вопросом привлечения инвестиций, поэтому интересуется приоритетными показателями для инвестора. Роман Егоров, основатель ортопедического цеха «InStep» является председателем организации инвалидов-ампутантов и подчеркивает, что отлично понимает требования потребителя в виду того, что сам уже 15 лет использует протез. Снятие мерок для изготовления протеза можно произвести удаленно ― достаточно прислать фотографию. При производстве применяются современные материалы, а также новые технологии и подходы к протезированию. Уже через три дня клиент получает готовое изделие. Компания выразила заинтересованность в увеличении доли рынка и формировании наиболее удачного позиционирования. Проект «Encora», нацеленный на разработку биодеградируемых систем для адресной терапии дентальных заболеваний и профилактики нарушений микрофлоры полости рта представил Павел Некрашевич, генеральный директор и основатель. Компания выделяется тем, что предлагает рынку биодеградируемые микроконтейнеры с биологически активными соединениями, которые помогают компаниям, специализирующимся на продукции Oral Care, увеличить стабильность компонентов на 15-20%. Представители проекта обсудили с экспертами то, насколько доступно удается передать в короткой презентации задачи их деятельности и обратились за оценкой дорожной карты и рентабельности дела, а также анализом перспектив запуска бизнеса на зарубежном рынке. Проект «KITIBOX», представленный Денисом Коряковым, воплотил в реальность пожелания владельцев кошек к наполнителю для туалета. Он почти месяц удерживает запах, не прилипает к лапкам и не пылит, а также не вынуждает хозяина постоянно убирать комочки и мыть лоток. Предпринимателей волновали вопросы о том, стоит ли позиционировать товар, как импортный и нужно ли выходить в розничные сети с учетом того, что им отходит почти вся прибыль с продаж, а главное какой нише соответствует данное предложение ― это продукт для массового потребителя или люксовый? Собравшиеся на встречу представители бизнес-сообщества, менторы и инвесторы ответили на большую часть вопросов участников, помогли разобраться в сложных ситуациях, а также поделились ценными рекомендациями по дальнейшим шагам в развитии своего дела, основываясь на собственном опыте предпринимательской деятельности. Общение после официальной части продолжилось в рамках нетворкинга. Подобные встречи будут проводиться на регулярной основе. Узнать расписание встреч и подать заявку на участие можно у представителей СОБА.

Наставники, наставляемые поделились и победами, и трудностями в этом полугодовом марафоне роста бизнеса. Работа в наставнических парах, где опытный предприниматель анализирует, рекомендует, помогает внедрить в бизнес новые технологии, решения - самое лучшее «лекарство» для начинающего предпринимателя. А совместные встречи, бизнес-разборы, как отмечали многие предприниматели, стали наиболее эффективными за период обучения: менялось мышление, финансовые показатели, легче переживались все кризисы. На проекте у предпринимателей-участников появилось много друзей-партнёров. В такой обстановке невозможно было впасть в панику, отчаяние, а также стало возможно увеличить рост бизнеса на 25%, официально создать новые рабочие места, занять позиции лидера-руководителя. Ольга Петрова, дизайнер интерьеров и выпускница Программы, отозвалась об обучении так: «Спасибо, что пригласили принять участие в этой программе, которая переменила мою жизнь! Спасибо моему наставнику, Пчелинцевой Юлии, ставшей за это время другом. Спасибо всем участникам и огромное спасибо команде-организатору этого масштабного проекта. Нас не оставляют, нам всегда готовы помочь и ответить на все наши вопросы! Это огромный опыт! Знания, которые мы получили от наших спикеров бесценны!» Поздравляем участников с окончанием Программы и выражаем благодарность за организацию работы по проекту талантливым руководителям - Вере Прасол и Елене Мозговой.

Разбор кейсов провел партнер Центра предпринимательства ― Союз организаций бизнес-ангелов (СОБА). Прямую трансляцию мероприятия можно было посмотреть на страницах организаций в Facebook. Открыл встречу генеральный директор ООО «Центр предпринимательства» Денис Дидковский:  «Считаю, что проведение встреч в рамках программы Startup Huddle в онлайн-формате дает нам значительные преимущества. Это возможность привлечения к одной сессии большего числа экспертов не только из города проведения мероприятия. Например, стартапы из петербургского сообщества смогут выйти за рамки площадки и поучаствовать в московских сессиях. Центр предпринимательства, оператор Startup Huddle в России, планирует регулярно проводить мероприятия с привлечением инвесторов, ведущих предпринимателей, членов генсовета  «Деловой России» и приглашаем всех заинтересованных к участию. Ближайшая встреча состоится в четверг, 23 апреля». В ходе встречи было рассмотрено 4 проекта. Первым выступил Александр Холмяков, основатель онлайн-платформы товаров и услуг для детей LOYQ. Это первый онлайн-проект, который предоставляет различные образовательные и развлекательные сервисы для детей и их родителей на одной платформе. Кроме того, на всей площадке действует единая бонусная система. Разработка платформы началась в 2018 году, а уже через год на ней был создан интернет-магазин LOYQ Store, вокруг которого формируются все сервисы, разрабатываемые силами стартапа. Площадка также интегрирует сторонние решения других стартапов, которые предлагают свои уникальные продукты. Стартап обратился к экспертам за рекомендациями по выходу в точку безубыточности при условии активного развития платформы. Собравшиеся обратили внимание на необходимость работы с целевой аудиторией проекта в социальных сетях и важность более четкого понимания реальных возможностей родителей и объемов ежемесячных затрат на содержание ребенка. Эксперты также обсудили позиционирование, уникальное предложение компании и возможности для роста. Руководитель проекта «Амбар» Станислав Неверов представил цифрового помощника и маркетплейс для всех участников сельскохозяйственного рынка. Стартап разрабатывает мобильную платформу для агробизнеса, которая позволяет купить, продать, доставить и отследить онлайн сельхозпродукцию и сопутствующие товары. Ввиду динамичности рынка и постоянном изменении цен, проект призван помочь фермерам получить максимальную стоимость за продажу зерна. Платформа обеспечивает прозрачность заключаемых сделок, предоставляя возможность контроля на каждом этапе. Эксперты совместно с участниками рассмотрели особенности маркетплейса и преимущества биржи, обсудили стадии реализации проекта и дали рекомендации по дальнейшим шагам и пересмотру статей расходов, осуществляемых до фактического старта проекта. Андрей Антропов представил проект по продаже и контрактному производству пигментов для перманентного макияжа Organic Pigments. Он отметил существующую проблему в индустрии красоты, связанную с использованием некачественных пигментов, что приводит к тяжелым последствиям как с эстетической точки зрения, так и для здоровья клиента. Компания сейчас проводит тестирование различных компонентов для создания пигмента высокого качества. В дальнейшем стартап планирует создать широкую палитру цветов, и наладить сотрудничество с школами перманентного макияжа. Руководитель проекта обосновал потребность в компетенции по построению дилерской сети, обсудил с экспертами особенности рынка и получил ряд рекомендаций по привлечению инвестиций. В завершении сессии выступил Вадим Антоневич, представив проект по созданию карманных сумок Powch. Стартап предлагает больше, чем просто сумку-шоппер. Powch ― это экологичная сумка для жизни, которая легко складывается в компактный чехол. Проект планирует осуществлять коллаборации с крупными брендами для создания уникального стиля сумки и продвижения идеи ее использования не только для походов в магазин, но и под любые другие повседневные задачи. Предложение несколько дороже аналогичных, представленных на рынке, но обладает высоким качеством и уникальным стилем. Вадим Антоневич отметил, что надеется через дизайн и стремление потребителя к самовыражению привить культуру осознанного потребления. Эксперты поддержали тренд, внесли предложения в сформулированную бизнес-модель, а также обсудили различные сценарии развития и продвижения. Собравшиеся обратили внимание стартапа на важность четкого понимания своей ниши и грамотного позиционирования, отметив, что дизайнерский сумки и решения с коллаборациями являются совершенно разными с точки зрения ведения бизнеса. Подводя итоги встречи, модератор Луиза Александрова, директор по развитию СОБА, напомнила всем участникам, что следующие мероприятия в формате программы Startup Huddle пройдут в Москве 23 апреля и 21 мая в Петербурге.

У нас в МТПП есть несколько форматов мероприятий. Startup Huddle – это более неформальная встреча по сравнению, например, с инвестиционными сессиями или заседаниями гильдий и комитетов , – объяснил в своем вступительном слове вице-президент МТПП Артем Далевич. – Эксперты – специалисты и предприниматели – приходят на наши встречи послушать выступления (питчи) стартаперов, чтобы предложить им помощь, дать свои экспертные рекомендации и посодействовать развитию инновационных проектов» . Первым свой проект «Wellshapes» – журнальный стол и тренажер для занятий фитнесом дома – собравшимся представил дизайнер Иван Тайгунов. «В период прошлогоднего “коронакризисного” сидения дома я стал изучать рынок тренажеров. Отметил, что множество покупаемых потребителями тренажеров со временем превращаются в вешалки, “уезжают” в гаражи или на дачи» . Спикер создал «многофункциональный» деревянный тренажер, который в свободное от занятий время можно использовать как журнальный столик. Он выдерживает нагрузку до 300 кг и «лаконично вписывается в различные интерьеры». К столу прилагаются видеотренировки. Иван Тайгунов рассказал об основных характеристиках своего бизнес-проекта, его тестировании в соцсетях, положении на рынке и финансовых запросах. Алексей Шиманский выступил с питч-презентацией «SKILLFOLIO» – цифрового университета диагностики и развития универсальных компетенций (SOFT SKILLS). По данным аналитического центра НАФИ, сообщил он, 53% россиян разочарованы в своей профессии и ищут новые сферы развития. «Наш продукт представляет собой комбинацию методологических и технологических методов, разработанных командой экспертов в области психологии, нейрофизиологии и разработки IT-решений» , – отметил спикер. Платформа позволяет диагностировать гибкие навыки и компетенции, составить их цифровой профиль и персональную траекторию обучения, проводить мониторинг этого обучения и корректировать его. Линейки программ SKILLFOLIO разработаны для саморазвития детей, подростков, взрослых и развития сотрудников компаний, создания корпоративных команд. Спикер проанализировал конкурентов проекта и его преимущества (авторская методика на сильной научной базе, индивидуальная траектория на базе искусственного интеллекта и т.д.). Он отметил, что проект уже является прибыльным (маржа составляет 30%) и рассказал о дальнейшей стратегии его развития. Денис Степанов представил собравшимся «ТопЗвук» – мультиязычную образовательную инновационную карту России в виртуальном формате, объяснил, какие объекты на нее наносятся (музеи, парки, памятники, знаковые исторические места и т.д.), а также описал ее работу. «Например, централизованная карта России и районов Москвы позволит единым проектом закрыть многие вопросы образования, туризма, культуры» , – пояснил он. Сейчас проект находится на стадии прототипа. Феруза Нигманова выступила с презентацией проекта «Автоматизация инвентаризации на складах с помощью дронов». По ее словам, ручная инвентаризация рождает множество проблем – невозможность осуществлять операции с товарами во время этого процесса; необходимость наличия у работника склада спецдопуска к высотным работам; необходимость привлечения значительных ресурсов и т.д. Решить их поможет применение дронов, оборудованных системой сканирования кодов, способных самостоятельно подсчитывать количество коробов в паллетах и анализировать целостность упаковки. «Каждое решение будет разрабатываться под конкретный склад» , – подчеркнула спикер. Она описала конкурентные риски на этом рынке и возможные решения по их устранению, а также выгоды автоматизации данного процесса по сравнению с человеческим фактором (по представленным подсчетам, дрон в 7,5 раз эффективнее человека). По словам докладчика, на сегодняшний момент проекту нужен выход на российский ритейл, а в перспективе – выход на рынки СНГ. Эксперты активно обсуждали каждый проект и давали по нему свои рекомендации. Модератором мероприятия выступил управляющий партнер HIC Capital Group, член Управляющего совета Молодежной финансовой лиги Николай Персиянов.

В рамках международной программы, целью которой является образование, развитие и сплочение предпринимательских сообществ, два предпринимателя города получили возможность выступить с короткими презентациями своих проектов и получить обратную связь от инвесторов, менторов, успешных предпринимателей и представителей медиа. Лебедева Елена, генеральный директор ООО «Арбитранс», обратилась к экспертам за рекомендациями по способам преодоления недоверия и возражений со стороны клиента в процессе перехода с бесплатного экспресс-аудита к платному восстановлению бухгалтерского учёта. Представители бизнес-сообщества, уже прошедшие через подобный опыт рекомендовали компании организовать регулярные почтовые рассылки с напоминанием о себе потенциальным клиентам, а также была предложена идея ведения открытого диалога с заказчиками посредством канала на YouTube, где можно делиться последствиями неправильного ведения бухгалтерии для организации,  а также узнавать мнение подписчиков по таким вопросам. Смирнова Марина, представила собравшимся бренд верхней одежды  «Шинель» и выделила его конкурентные преимущества. Компания находится в поиске каналов для продвижения и привлечения новой аудитории. Эксперты предложили бренду определенные механизмы усиления уже имеющегося канала продаж в Instagram, а также озвучили потребность в расширении присутствия бренда в онлайне через создание и ведение аккаунтов в социальных сетях, разработке лендинга, добавления компании на Яндекс.Карты и установлению сотрудничества с блогосферой. Помимо увеличения доли в онлайне была высказана идея о важности демонстрации своих решений на выставках и прочих профильных мероприятиях с целью выхода на рынок и лучшего понимания уровня конкурентоспособности предложения. Общение участников с экспертами, обмен мнениями и контактами для дальнейшего сотрудничества продолжился в рамках нетворкинг сессии. Участники ушли с проверенными на практике современными решениями для выхода на совершенно новый уровень ведения бизнеса. Напомним, что любой желающий владелец малого или среднего бизнеса может принять участие в высоко зарекомендовавшей себя в мире программе Startup Huddle. Следующая встреча планируется в январе.

В этот раз были рассмотрены кейсы пяти участников. Олег Одиноких представил инжиниринговую компанию «Аэродин», основным фокусом которой с 2017 года является разработка и изготовление дронов. В этом году команда планирует сосредоточиться на обеспечении различных событий световыми формациями дронов. Компания намерена оказывать услуги по организации и проведении шоу, где светящиеся дроны в воздухе создают различные фигуры и делают эффектные перестроения. Аэродин уже занимается разработкой прототипа, планируя наделить свой продукт особыми свойствами устойчивости к погодным условиям и температурным режимам во время полета, что позволит расширить возможности применения дронов. У руководства компании есть понимание ситуации на рынке, потребностей потенциальных заказчиков и готовность к малым оперативным заказам. Олег Одиноких обратился к экспертам за рекомендациями по составу предложения для инвесторов и грамотному позиционированию предложения на рынке. Опытные предприниматели, эксперты, менторы и инвесторы проанализировали представленную бизнес-модель и выразили пожелания по ее корректировке, а также указали на необходимость проведения оценки ситуации на мировом рынке ввиду кризисных обстоятельств и отмены всех крупных мероприятий на неопределенный срок. Ян Столяр рассказал о проекте Admin.Sale по оказанию ИТ-поддержки для микро- и малого бизнеса. По сути, компания за абонентскую плату помогает заказчику решить определенные задачи: отстроить процесс поддержки под требования клиента, нанять грамотных сотрудников и включить клиентов по договору оферты без предварительного аудита. Ян Столяр определил бизнес-модель компании, как маркетплейс между пользователем и исполнителем-администратором. К экспертам предприниматель обратился с запросом на привлечение большего количества клиентов и за рекомендациями по поиску инвестора. Гости проконсультировали выступающего относительно вложения усилий в свое продвижение, посоветовав уделить внимание активному информированию о своих услугах, чтобы прочно занять свое место на рынке. Кроме того, эксперты подсказали возможность интеграции в банковские структуры, которые работают с представителями малого бизнеса, и обсудили перспективы взаимодействия с каждой конкретной группой заказчиков из микро и макро бизнеса. Анастасия Василевская выступила с презентацией музыкального образовательного фестиваля SNAME, который пройдет 27-28 июня в Санкт-Петербурге. В течение двух дней в рамках фестиваля пройдут лекции, мастер-классы и public-talks с успешными преподавателями, выдающимися деятелями, экспертами и известными представителями музыкальной индустрии. Участники узнают методику написания музыки и съемки клипов, возможности владения своим голосом, особенности продвижения и монетизации музыкального продукта, а также рассмотрят вопросы создания бренда, необходимости защиты авторских прав и многое другое. На площадке пройдут концерты и выступления диджеев, а также будет развернута выставочная экспозиция, где состоится демонстрация нового звукового оборудования и ярмарка отраслевых вакансий. Анастасия Василевская подчеркнула стремление создать фестиваль европейского уровня для последующего вывода мероприятия на мировую арену. К собравшимся она обратилась с тем, что спонсоры проявляют заинтересованность к перспективному проекту, но не готовы поддерживать его в первый год на самом старте. Команда ищет способы привлечения спонсоров и находится на этапе формирования маркетинговой стратегии. С проектом, который фактически является платформой для развития музыкального образования, эксперты порекомендовали обратиться в Комитет по молодежной политике и взаимодействию с общественными организациями. Также собравшиеся обсудили пути заключения спонсорских контрактов и предостерегли о возможных сложностях в работе над фестивалем. Андрей Богдан представил на встрече в рамках программы Startup Huddle маркетплейс по продаже строительных материалов YesStroy. Портал является своего рода агрегатором, соединяющим оптовых поставщиков с покупателем и предоставляющим возможность выбора минимальной и оптимальной цены. Проектом занимается опытная команда, которая уже 15 лет в строительном бизнесе. Андрей Богдан выразил заинтересованность в поиске партнера-инвестора, в связи с чем вышел к экспертам с запросом необходимых шагов по привлечению инвестиций в действующий бизнес. Эксперты провели анализ возможностей и специфики работы строительного агрегатора и дали ряд рекомендаций по взаимодействию с производителями и отраслевыми поставщиками. Собравшиеся рекомендовали уделить особое внимание определению бизнес-ниши, формированию четкого позиционирования себя на рынке и настройке логистики. Петр Мовчан представил компанию Portal Energy, которая занимается производством зарядных станций для электромобилей и ведет работу по развитию этой инфраструктуры в России. Команда уже установила в некоторых городах зарядные станции для электрокаров и ведет переговоры с крупными компаниями о расширении зоны покрытия и взаимовыгодном сотрудничестве. На рынке компанию выгодно отличает возможность предоставления зарядных станций с накопителями, что чрезвычайно важно в условиях передвижения на большие расстояния. Вместе с предпринимателями и экспертами Петр Мовчан обсудил главные точки концентрации бизнеса и выслушал рекомендации по направленному фокусу внимания в работе. Эксперты выразили пожелание в проведении более точной оценки емкости рынка и проговорили маркетинговые задачи бренда для последующего выхода компании на европейскую арену. Также собравшиеся обсудили использование краудфандинговых площадок и особенности процессов инвестирования. Партнер Центра предпринимательства регулярно проводит встречи представителей бизнес-сообщества, менторов и инвесторов с целью помочь участникам разобраться в сложных ситуациях и дать рекомендации по дальнейшим шагам в развитии своего дела.

В международном формате Startup Huddle были сделаны семь презентаций, по которым эксперты клуба дали обратную связь и рекомендации. С приветствием к участникам встречи обратился член координационного совета, председатель комитета по переработке отходов и вторичным ресурсам «Деловой России» Александр Кобенко. Он отметил, что экологические аспекты оказывают огромное влияние на экономику и политику, и быстрое развитие экологической повестки создает беспрецедентные возможности для инвесторов, стартаперов и разработчиков технологий. «Сегодня мы будем говорить больше о переработке отходов. Повестка широкая, очень много нам нужно проработать, нужно понимать, какие новые продукты производить из вторичных материалов. Пока мы полагаемся на западные технологии и оборудование, но очень нуждаемся в собственных разработках. Важно, чтобы они были инновационными, прорывными и конкурентными на мировом рынке» , — сказал он. Председатель Startup клуба и генеральный директор Центра предпринимательства Денис Дидковский отметил: «Startup клубу исполняется год в апреле. Площадка уникальна тем, что на ней проходят не инвест-питчи, а питчи руководителей проектов, которым нужна помощь именно от экспертного сообщества. За время работы наш формат доказал свою эффективность, многие стартапы нашли партнёров и необходимую им поддержку на встречах клуба. Надеюсь, ее получат сегодня и проекты в сфере утилизации отходов, весьма актуальной для современной России отрасли» . Гостем клуба стал операционный директор Кластера энергоэффективности Сколково Олег Перцовский. Он выступил с презентацией акселерационной программы в сфере экологии GreenTech Startup Booster и рассказал о преимуществах участия в ней для индустриальных партнеров и стартапов. В качестве экспертов во встрече приняли участи члены координационного и генерального советов «Деловой России» Олег Мисевра, Владимир Кузнецов, Дмитрий Дулькин, Наталья Кириллова, Денис Дидковский, Алексей Винниченко, Михаил Фомичев, Алексей Шатров, Ирина Писаревская, Валерий Калюжный. Модератором встречи выступил партнер CBI Pioneer, эксперт по инвестиционной привлекательности и региональным институтам развития Дмитрий Ягодкин. Участники представили семь проектов. Чистый двор с умной контейнерной площадкой «Никонт» Евгений Слиняков представил умную контейнерную площадку «Никонт», которая уже применяется в некоторых дворах Нижнего Новгорода. По словам авторов проекта, такая площадка позволяет платить за вывоз ТКО по факту, а не по нормативу, контролирует заполняемость контейнеров и своевременность вывоза мусора. Контейнеры доступны по электронному ключу, предусмотрены отдельные емкости под макулатуру, стекло, пластик, металл и несортируемые отходы. Команда проекта ищет помощь в выходах на региональные органы власти, которые принимают решения об оснащении контейнерных площадок во дворах. Эко Карбо — производство технического углерода из отработанных шин Александра Журавлева рассказала о компании, которая производит технический углерод, пиролизное топливо и металлолом в результате утилизации отработанных шин. Для России этот проект уникален: компании удалось запустить полностью безотходное производство, обеспечить высокое качество и маржинальность конечных продуктов и сформировать растущий спрос. Команда проекта заинтересована в инвестициях — в планах пятикратный рост производства. Программно-аппаратный комплекс для автоматической сортировки бытовых отходов с применением алгоритмов компьютерного зрения Компания Александра Неволина разрабатывает комплекс для сортировки ТБО с 2018 года. Рынок в России в данной сфере плотно занят зарубежными компаниями, которые предлагают оптические сортировщики, разделяющие отходы с помощью спектрального анализа и отстрела сжатым воздухом. Разработка компании Александра Неволина сортирует и классифицирует отходы с помощью дельта-робота и нейронных сетей. Одно из главных ее преимуществ перед зарубежными аналогами — сортировка нескольких видов отходов одной установкой. Компания ищет финансирование и экспертную поддержку для развития на российском и мировом рынке. Экобот — роботизированный модуль автоматической сортировки мусора Денис Ефимцев выступил с презентацией робота, который устанавливается вместо мусорных контейнерных площадок, принимает мусор от жителей и предварительно сортирует его сам по основным группам. Среди потребностей проекта — площадка для пилотирования, тестирование продаж вторсырья и финансирование. Аврора Бореалис — установка сжигания опасных отходов с узлом глубокой очистки отходящих дымовых газов Иван Шашков представил барабанную печь для утилизации и обезвреживания отходов с узлом глубокой очистки выбросов. Технология может применяться нефтяными и металлургическими компаниями, а также для утилизации отходов. Авторы проекта оценивают сокращение текущих выбросов на 40–90% с применением этой технологии. Компания ищет партнеров для пилотных проектов. Термокаталитическая установка переработки и утилизации отходов «Виротех» Виктор Качура рассказал о производстве мусороперерабатывающих комплексов по технологии термокаталитического обезвреживания. Печи, работающие на этой технологии, могут применяться для утилизации твердых коммунальных, медицинских, резинотехнических и промышленных отходов. Их отличает высокая энергоэффективность при низких капитальных и эксплуатационных затратах, несколько ступеней очистки газов, а также возможность кастомизации. Выпуск отходоперерабатывающих комплексов «НеваЭкоМаш» Сергей Ложкин представил проект, который предполагает создание инжиниринговой компании для выпуска в России и на экспорт высокотехнологичных  комплексов по переработке любых видов отходов, осадков сточных вод и др. Сейчас создана единственная в России опытная установка на 100 кг сырья в час, отработаны режимы, проведены показы. Компания ищет инвесторов. График ближайших мероприятий в 2021 году: 15 апреля — туризм; 29 апреля — финтех.

Эксперты клуба прокомментировали семь проектов. Среди экспертов присутствовали члены генерального совета «Деловой России» Максим Авербух, Олег Пухов, Алексей Захаров, Наталья Кириллова, Александр Сегаль, Александр Шатров, Ирина Писаревская, Сергей Гебель, Валерий Калюжный, Дмитрий Камерлохер, Денис Дидковский, Александр Масленников, Виталий Арбузов, Григорий Жуховицкий, Ашот Даниелян, представители членов генсовета Евгения Теплякова, Вадима Филатова, Григория Березкина, Алексея Кучмина, а также сопредседатель Саратовского отделения «Деловой России» Игорь Александров. Модерировал сессию предприниматель, основатель и управляющий партнёр СОВЕТ#1 Семен Фомин. Открывая встречу, председатель Startup клуба и гендиректор Центра предпринимательства Денис Дидковский напомнил, что формат клуба направлен на то, чтобы проекты получили поддержку, экспертную оценку и рекомендации от отраслевых экспертов, членов генерального и координационного советов Деловой России, а также представителей профильных структур институтов развития и корпораций. Презентациям стартапов предшествовали несколько комментариев от отраслевых экспертов. Директор департамента цифровой трансформации ПЭК Олег Сковородников рассказал о международном опыте развития электротранспорта. «Электрогрузовик выгоднее дизельной тяги в три раза. Электротяга может существенно повлиять на экономику всего электротранспорта. Но Россия пока в высшую лигу электротранспорта не попадает» , — отметил он. Он также подчеркнул, что Россия вряд ли может рассчитывать на массовое использование беспилотных грузовиков Tesla Semi — скорее стоит ориентировать на европейские и китайские технологии, а также на собственные разработки. По словам Олега Сковородникова, ПЭК открыта сотрудничеству с российскими проектами и готова предоставить им экспертную поддержку и помочь в привлечении финансирования — особенно это касается беспилотных технологий, которые можно использовать для грузовиков. Председатель подкомитета по развитию электротранспортной отрасли «Деловой России» Максим Авербух выразил опасения, что Россия может остаться единственным в мире пользователем двигателя внутреннего сгорания. «Весь мир переходит на электромобили. В Евросоюзе продажи электромобилей составили 20% от всех продаж личного транспорта» , – сказал он. Он также отметил, что сопротивляться этому процессу бессмысленно, и по возможности нужно наоборот постараться его возглавить. Также Максим Авербух представил проект опытно-экспериментальных зарядных станций на заправках НК Роснефть с ПО интегрированным с точками продаж. После дискуссии были представлены еще шесть проектов. Агродронгрупп — инновационные системы сельхоз мониторинга и повышения урожайности Александр Труфанов представил инновационные агробеспилотники для повышения урожайности в сельском хозяйстве. Услуги фермеры получают через специальную платформу: у компании есть операторы беспилотных летательных аппаратов, фотограмметристы, специалисты в точном земледелии и спектральной аналитике, программисты. Аналогичные системы используют космические снимки и выполняют беспилотную аэросъёмку спектральными камерами — Агродронгрупп же, помимо этого, корректирует результаты спектральной аэросъемки по наземным измерениям, что повышает достоверность полученных данных. Роботизированный энергоэффективный комбайн с электрическими приводами рабочих механизмов Павел Гончаров рассказал об инновационном наборе электротехнических комплектующих и программного обеспечения, которые позволяют значительно снизить стоимость электрокомбайна и повышают его надежность. Комбайн управляется с применением технологий искусственного интеллекта. Разработка может быть применена к базовым моделям зерноуборочных комбайнов, выпускаемых на территории СНГ и других стран. Мощные и безопасные накопители на литий-ионных аккумуляторах Александр Логинов выступил с презентаций проекта, посвященного разработке и производству высоковольтовых батарей для электромобилей. Его компания уже разработала шесть вариантов батарей для Nissan Leaf, запустила собственный канал сбыта через YouTube и планирует выходить на рынки Украины, Европы и США. Подводный осмотровый аппарат TurtleRO Андрей Шипатов представил телеуправляемый необитаемый подводный аппарат TurtleROV2 для выполнения подводных инспекционных работ с ориентацией по видео и функцией автосопровождения объектов. Аппарат позволяет обеспечить экологическую безопасность работ при проведении геофизических изысканий и добычи полезных ископаемых в море. Опытные образцы успешно прошли пилотную эксплуатацию. СмартАэро — сеть дистанционно пилотируемых мини дирижаблей под управлением ИИ Артур Пиков рассказал о проекте сети дирижаблей и дронов, которые могут быть полезны для обеспечения связи в недоступных регионах, в строительстве, для освещения, подъема грузов, спасения в чрезвычайных ситуациях и в системах мониторинга. Среди особенностей дирижаблей он назвал возможность изменения объема шара, минимальные энергопотери при грузоперевозках, максимальную эффективность под управлением искусственного интеллекта и патентопригодность. FIXAR Равиль Кидрячев представил FIXAR — разработчика коммерческих дронов. Рынок дронов уже достаточно объемен, однако, по словам спикера, существующие решения имеют ограничения, которые негативно влияют на экономику бизнеса, который их использует. Разработка FIXAR отличается аэродинамическими характеристиками, имеет встроенный автопилот и наземную станцию управления. За счет технических характеристик продукт экономически эффективнее аналогов. Разработка FIXAR уже применяется для аэрофотосъемки Эльбруса, поисково-спасательных работ, биозащиты культур, доставки биоматериалов и в ряде других проектов. График ближайших мероприятий: 4 марта – искусственный интеллект; 18 марта – машиностроение; 1 апреля – утилизация отходов.

Встречу открыл председатель клуба, генеральный директор Центра предпринимательства Денис Дидковский. «Startup клуб “Деловой России” проходит с апреля 2020 года два раза в месяц. У нас необычный формат — не инвестиционный питч, а деловое мероприятие, направленное на налаживание деловых контактов. В первую очередь, это площадка для делороссов — средний и крупный бизнес, который мы приглашаем к участию, чтобы они познакомились со стартапами. Но не любопытство является движущей силой нашего формата, а помощь начинающим проектам — в виде пилотных проектов, контактов с крупными корпорациями, экспертных мнений и деловых связей» , — сказал он. Участников встречи также приветствовал член генерального совета, заместитель председателя комитета «Деловой России» по развитию транспортной инфраструктуры Алексей Кучмин. «Транспортная инфраструктура — действительно интересная тематика, потому что мы все вольно или невольно как водители и как пешеходы сталкиваемся с ней. И всегда интересно посмотреть, какие проекты предлагают молодые предприниматели. Я сам в сфере транспортной инфраструктуры много лет, сам хожу по тротуарам и езжу по дорогам, и всегда хочется что-то улучшить, добавить какие-то вещи, сделать удобнее, чтобы самому получать удовольствие от того, что вижу» , — сказал он. Во встрече приняли участие члены генерального совета «Деловой России» Давид Якобашвили, Альберт Еганян, Григорий Жуховицкий, Александр Сегаль, Андрей Черногоров, Михаил Косарев, Виталий Арбузов, Владимир Кузнецов, Тимур Айдельдинов, Павел Савкин, Ольга Куликова, Дмитрий Камерлохер, Дмитрий Боярко, Алексей Захаров, Эдуард Радославов. Модератором встречи выступила начальник отдела акселерации ФАУ «РОСДОРНИИ» Юлия Оганова. Участники представили семь проектов. SmaSS — единая мобильная платформа для решения любых вопросов вокруг автомобиля Антон Крамаров представил мобильное приложение, которое представляет собой единое окно для решения всех задач водителя. В приложении предусмотрены такие функции, как помощь при парковке в городе, охрана и экстренное оповещение о событиях вокруг автомобиля, аналитика доступности автомоек и др. Через приложение можно также взаимодействовать со сторонними, уже привычными водителю сервисами. Проект заинтересован в стратегическом партнерстве с крупными корпорациями. «Среда» — программные решения V2x для обеспечения безопасности и повышения эффективности управления дорожным движением Ярослав Домарацкий рассказал о технологиях, которые помогают предотвратить дорожно-транспортное происшествие. Продукт представляет собой комплекс программного обеспечения для автомобильного бортового оборудования, оборудования для инфраструктуры дороги и для серверной части. Команда проекта ищет PR-поддержку; коллег, заинтересованных в совместном продвижении продуктов и услуг на основе технологии V2x, а также партнеров и возможности для представления своего продукта на международных площадках. Park&Go — умные парковки Владимир Красильников выступил с презентацией мобильного приложения, которое помогает водителям сэкономить время на поиск парковки, а городу — оптимизировать парковочную инфраструктуру. В запросе к экспертам он обозначил интерес к выходу на потенциальных заказчиков в администрациях городов и регионов России и к возможности масштабирования в городах Европы, а также поиск финансирования. Traffic Data — решения для интеллектуальных транспортных систем по анализу транспортного потока по видео Иван Чебыкин представил комплекс программных решений для мониторинга дорожного движения, фиксирования инцидентов, умного паркинга и управления дорожным движением в целом. Представленные им решения позволяют в реальном времени анализировать видеозаписи с камер наблюдения и от беспилотных летательных аппаратов. Компания ищет партнеров и возможности для тестирования своих разработок на городских камерах видеонаблюдения. «МСУ» — адаптивное управление транспортными потоками в условиях городских магистралей Денис Митюхин рассказал о проекте единой платформы управления транспортными системами, которая моделирует движение транспортных средств, формируя политику управления светофорами на основе текущей ситуации. Сейчас режимы светофоров устанавливаются вручную, представленное решение позволит автоматизировать эту работу и выполнять ее дистанционно. Для развития проекта ему необходима помощь в организации взаимодействия с заказчиками в регионах, а также инвестиции. «Улей» — интеллектуальная транспортная система с мобильными датчиками контроля за дорожной обстановкой Антон Куховаренко выступил с презентаций распределенной мобильной системы мониторинга дорожного движения «Улей». Суть системы в том, что любое транспортное средство в потоке может оказаться прибором фиксации нарушений. Для водителей это означает, что соблюдать ПДД нужно везде, а не только там, где установлены привычные камеры — значит, внедрение системы способно повлиять на поведенческую модель водителей и повысить культуру вождения. Сейчас система на стадии активной разработки и тестирования. «ИТС» — интеллектуальная система управления сборными грузоперевозками Александр Лада рассказал об интеллектуальной платформе управления логистическими ресурсами. Система автоматически составляет расписание работы  грузовиков и водителей, составляет маршрут движения с учетом приоритета заказов, местоположения грузовиков, требований к типу прицепа, наличия специального оборудования и корректирует план по фактическим событиям реального времени по данным мобильного приложения водителя и систем ГЛОНАС/GPS мониторинга. График ближайших мероприятий в 2021 году: 24 июня — металлургия; 8 июля — робототехника; 22 июля — энерго- и электрооборудование; 5 августа — ИТ-проекты (софт).

Встреча традиционно прошла в формате Startup Huddle: предприниматели рассказали о своих проектах, а эксперты оценили их сильные и слабые стороны и предложили идеи для развития. В качестве экспертов выступили представители крупнейших банков, фондов и институтов развития, а также члены генсовета «Деловой России» Александр Сегаль, Александр Масленников, Валерий Калюжный и Алексей Мостовщиков. Модерировал дискуссию предприниматель Семён Фомин. Участники питч-сессии представили восемь проектов. Интерактивный робот-оператор call-центра Zvonobot Игорь Ганин представил SAAS-сервис, который помогает автоматизировать исходящие и входящие звонки. Звонобот заменяет операторов колл-центра: он может распознавать слова собеседника, синтезировать ответы и полноценно вести разговор. В ближайшие пять лет компания планирует выйти на оборот 1 млрд руб. в год. Команда проекта ищет инвесторов и партнеров, а также заинтересована в консультации по стратегии выхода на международный рынок. Маркетплейс интеграционных решений на платформе «Агредатор» Константин Юрьев рассказал о платформе «Агредатор». Она появилась в ответ на рост количества поставщиков данных и стоимости интеграции, из-за которых потребители данных не успевают за появлением новых сервисов. На платформе планируется развивать открытый маркетплейс, который объединяет потребителей и разработчиков адаптеров (решений для интеграции) и задает стандарт разработки и использования интеграции. Компания ищет инвестиции на запуск маркетплейса, помощь в продвижении и рекламе, а также новые каналы продаж. SmartKey AI — умная клавиатура для клиентов банка Продукт компании Ильгиза Муртазина — это white label клавиатура для банков – cистема электронных кнопок, которые интегрируются в любое приложение и позволяют, например, сделать банковский перевод. По расчетам авторов проекта, применение такой клавиатуры позволяет сократить время выполнения банковских операций в 1,5– раза, увеличивает удовлетворенность клиентов на 15–20% и обеспечивает безопасное присутствие банка в любой социальной сети или мессенджере. Основная идея в том, что банковские услуги должны быть доступны в небанковских приложениях. Компания обратилась с запросом на всестороннюю помощь в развитии проекта: начиная с финансовой и заканчивая менторской и маркетинговыми ресурсами. Craft Talk — контактный центр банка для работы текстовых каналов с помощью ИИ Денис Петухов выступил с презентацией платформы для работы с текстовыми обращениями. Система постоянно учится у операторов обрабатывать обращения клиентов. За счет этого, по данным компании, 60% диалогов обрабатываются автоматически, а операторы контактного центра работают в два раза эффективнее. Craft Talk уже работает, например, на mos.ru — количество обработанных обращений выросло в 4,6 раза, а 57% из них обрабатывает искусственный интеллект без участия оператора. Legium — сервис для быстрой подписи документов в электронном виде Представитель Legium Иван Хаустов начал свою презентацию со слов: «Это мы придумали, как подписать документ за пять секунд» . Среди клиентов этого сервиса уже есть такие гиганты, как Mail.ru, крупные курьерские службы, рестораны, инвестиционно-риэлторские компании. Сервис позволяет начать работу сразу после регистрации в нем, не требует флешек и токенов. С точки зрения закона, такая электронная подпись считается усиленной неквалифицированной. Credit Call — контактный центр для банков Валентин Ибрагимов представил контактный центр для обработки финансового трафика. Сервис анализирует трафик находит узкие места, выбирает логику и способ обработки трафика, использует собственные скрипты с многоуровневой обработкой и в итоге кратно увеличивает конверсию. Сервис ищет партнеров и клиентов среди банков и микрофинансовых организаций. Andata — цифровой паспорт Проект Алексея Бирюкова — это онлайн-сервис рекомендаций по цифровому маркетингу на основе искусственного интеллекта. Разработчик запатентовал алгоритм отслеживания посетителя сайта более точный, чем технологии cookie и fingerprint. Сервис использует машинное обучение, которое анализирует 10 тысяч параметров, чтобы сделать маркетинговые кампании более качественными. Еще одна разработка внутри проекта — решение по настройке рекламных кампаний на основе данных. Проект ищет инвестиции для выхода на глобальный рынок. SweetCard — сервис формирования контента для клиентов банков Василий Кузнецов представил сервис формирования персонального контента и предложений для клиентов банков — аналог раздела stories в соцсетях, только уже в мобильном приложении банка, используемый как канал вовлечения клиентов. Персонализированный контент формируется на основе данных банков и внешних партнеров. Компания ищет клиентов — банки, готовые внедрять такой функционал в своих мобильных приложениях. Эксперты клуба прокомментировали каждый из представленных проектов. Член генсовета «Деловой России» Александр Масленников предложил поделиться этим проектами с комитетом «Деловой России» по автоматизации решений для прослеживаемости движения товаров и денежных средств и комитетом по банковскому делу. «Члены и руководители этих комитетов могут быть хорошими партнерами для практически всех проектов» , — пояснил он. Кроме того, он отметил, что многие проекты могут быть интересны инвестиционному клубу «Деловой России» и лично выбрал три проекта, с которыми готов познакомиться подробнее. В завершение встречи член генсовета «Деловой России» и глава клуба Денис Дидковский  пригласил экспертов и спикеров к участию во Всемирной неделе предпринимательства, которая пройдет с 16 по 22 ноября. В частности, 19 ноября на площадке Деловой России пройдет расширенная встреча Startup клуба с привлечением международных экспертов и иностранных инвесторов. И познакомил собравшихся с графиком ближайших питч-сессий: 19 октября — экспорт (Германия); 11 октября — медицина (в рамках форума АСИ «Сильные идеи для нового времени»); 19 октября — Startup клуб в рамках Всемирной недели предпринимательства, экспорт; 3 декабря — цифровая промышленность.

Эксперты встретились с инициаторами проектов, открывающих новый взгляд на традиционные финансовые услуги и сервисы. В формате StartUp Huddle участники представили шесть бизнес-моделей, направленных на улучшение качества обслуживания клиентов финансовыми организациями. В качестве экспертов от «Деловой России» выступили члены Генерального совета Сергей Гебель, Алексей Захаров, Ольга Куликова, Анна Надобных, Алексей Шатров, представитель Комитета по банковскому делу «Деловой России». Также, в мероприятии приняли участие представители Центрального банка РФ, Газпромбанка, Сбербанка России, ВЭБ.РФ, Промсвязьбанка, МСП Банка, Совкомбанка и Банка ДОМ.РФ. Модерировал дискуссию предприниматель Семён Фомин. С приветственным словом к участникам мероприятия обратился член Генсовета «Деловой России» и глава клуба Денис Дидковский. Он поблагодарил выступающих за качественную подготовку проектов. Делоросс отметил, что участники мероприятия смогут получить не только экспертную оценку, но и инвестиционную поддержку проектов. «Упор нашего формата больше на экспертную поддержку. Нам важно, чтобы участники, среди которых присутствуют члены профильного комитета «Деловой России», отобрали проекты, которым они готовы помогать и дали обратную связь. Нужно, чтобы стартапы развивались в той отрасли, где они заявлены», — отметил глава клуба. В рамках питч-сессии было представлено шесть бизнес-моделей, направленных на модернизацию финансовых технологий в области платежей и переводов, кредитования и краудфандинга, а также управления капиталом. Умный фронт для повышения продаж инвестиционных и накопительных продуктов Основатель проекта «Банк будущего» Александр Виссаров представил умную систему подбора инвестиционного пакета для физических лиц — Asol. Клиенты банков часто задумываются об инвестициях, но не знают, как правильно вкладывать деньги. Фронт Asol позволяет сотруднику банка подобрать инвестиционный портфель для клиента, с учётом размера его накоплений и целей инвестирования. Теперь любой человек сможет накопить на автомобиль, квартиру или стартовый капитал для бизнеса. Программа анализирует финансовые параметры клиента и формирует набор банковских продуктов, за счёт которых человек сможет накопить нужную сумму в заданный срок. Алгоритмы программы подстраиваются индивидуально под каждого клиента. Сервис стремительно набирает популярность среди российских банков. Сегодня фронт Asol работает в таких банках, как Уралсиб и Промсвязьбанк. Владельцы сервиса ищут партнёров и инвесторов для развития проекта на европейском рынке. Автоматизация в сфере кредитования Руководитель компании Sputnik credit conveyer Игорь Слезин помогает финансовым институтам автоматизировать бизнес-процессы проверки клиента, выдачи кредита и приема вклада. Сервис Sputnik, разработанный экспертами компании, в короткие сроки проверит кредитную историю клиента, оформит необходимые документы и рассчитает размер ссуды без участия менеджера. Игорь Слезин убеждён, что сотрудничество с его компанией позволит финансовым организациям ускорить процесс работы с клиентами и снизить риск потери средств. Компания планирует развивать сервис на азиатском рынке, поэтому ищет инвесторов, заинтересованных в расширении линейки продуктов. Член Генерального совета «Деловой России» и бизнес-посол делового объединения в Индии Ольга Куликова отметила, что у проекта есть все шансы развиваться на международном рынке, так как сервис является инновационным продуктом, не имеющим качественных аналогов. Робот-помощник для банков Основатель проекта TalkBank Михаил Попов представил сервис «Робот-помощник» для финансовых организаций. Сегодня банки вынуждены выделять огромные человеческие ресурсы на работу с клиентами (колл-центры, службы клиентской поддержки). «Робот-помощник» автоматизирует общение с клиентом без потери качества. Более того, операционная система позволит контролировать финансовые потоки организации, что значительно снизит комиссию за обслуживание клиента. Создатели проекта также предлагают интеграцию банковских функций в смартфон. Теперь, чтобы узнать статус заявки на кредит или открыть счёт, не нужно дожидаться часами ответа оператора. Достаточно сделать запрос в чат-бот, где умная система поможет оформить необходимые документы, обработать заявку и ответить на вопросы. Сервис налоговых вычетов Сооснователь сервиса «НДФЛка» Дмитрий Костальгин посмотрел с другой стороны на процесс оформления налогового вычета. Обычно люди едут в налоговую службу, долго стоят в очереди, собирают документы для оформления налоговых деклараций. Сервис «Быстровычет» сделает это всё за клиента. Компания предоставляет услуги по оформлению налогового вычета «под ключ». Эксперты сервиса «Быстровычет» оформят все необходимые документы и решат все вопросы. Клиенту останется только оставить заявку в приложении и получить деньги на карту. Сегодня у компании больше 101 тыс. клиентов, получивших налоговый вычет в короткие сроки без лишних усилий. Компания работает на рынке и продвигает проекты с 2012 года. Сейчас создатели сервиса ищут новых партнёров для развития компании и выхода на новые рынки. Онлайн-кредитование Платформа для онлайн-кредитования Happy Lend предпринимателя Алексея Чаленко позволяет клиентам быстро оформить кредит или рассрочку на бытовые расходы. Кредитный конвейер позволяет подать заявку на кредит и получить решение за две минуты. У компании много партнёров среди российских банков. Сервис является посредником между человеком, желающим оформить займ, и финансовой организацией. В перспективе создатели проекта планируют сделать «единое окно», которое позволит не переходить на сайт банка для оформления услуги. Инвестиции для чайников Создатель приложения Simple Invest Дмитрий Простов считает, что инвестировать может каждый. Для этого необязательно иметь профильное образование или умного друга — достаточно иметь смартфон. В мобильном приложении Simple Invest можно создать инвестиционный портфель самостоятельно, просто выбрав понравившееся предложение. Simple Invest – это не только мобильное приложение, но и платформа, на которой компании могут выставлять ценные бумаги. Так инвестирование становится доступным и привлекательных финансовым инструментом, позволяющим построить капитал самостоятельно. Участники встречи также услышали предложения и комментарии по проектам от представителей финансовых институтов и членов «Деловой России». «Мне радостно, что наряду с другими индустриальными вертикалями, которые регулярно проводятся в Startup клубе, дело дошло и до финтеха – очень динамичной и интересной отрасли, богатой технологическими решениями и уже зарекомендовавшей себя крупными компаниями, которые в этой отрасли выросли», — отметил модератор мероприятия Семён Фомин. Ближайшие мероприятия Startup клуба: 20 августа – экспорт; 3 сентября – IT- индустрия; 17 сентября – малая энергетика; 1 октября – медицина.

Традиционно организаторами мероприятия в формате Startup Huddle выступили «Деловая Россия» и Центр предпринимательства. Всемирная неделя предпринимательства — это международный проект, объединяющий более 180 стран-участниц и более 10 млн участников. Всемирная неделя предпринимательства в России проходит при поддержке министерства экономического развития России. Участников встречи приветствовал заместитель председателя комитета по развитию транспортной инфраструктуры «Деловой России» Алексей Кучмин. «Это крайне интересная отрасль и направление — всё, что связано с инфраструктурными объектами. Мы так или иначе с этими вопросами сталкиваемся и пересекаемся постоянно» , — отметил он. Кроме того, в числе экспертов выступили члены генерального совета «Деловой России»: Виталий Арбузов, Ольга Ткачева, Валерий Калюжный, Александр Сегаль, Владимир Кузнецов, Эдуард Радославов, Павел Савкин, Юрий Данилов. Модерировала встречу начальник отдела акселерации ФАУ «РОСДОРНИИ» Юлия Оганова. Участники представили семь проектов. Bus sharing — цифровая трансформация финансирования и модернизации общественного транспорта Лев Денисов обратил внимание на проблемы модернизации общественного транспорта. По его словам, сегодня недостаточно просто покупать автобусы, нужно в комплексе решать задачи участников отрасли: администрации, перевозчика, инвесторов. Стать этим комплексным решением может басшеринг. По аналогии с каршерингом это предоставление перевозчикам в аренду уже оборудованных транспортных средств в соответствии с требованиями заказчика. Программно-аппаратный комплекс «Умный шлагбаум» Александр Фадеев выступил с презентацией решения, которое фиксирует на фото все проезды на закрытую территорию. Таким образом, гостей можно вносить через личный кабинет в течение минуты или открыть шлагбаум с помощью бесплатного мобильного приложения. По словам спикера, стоимость ПАК «Умный шлагбаум» ниже аналогов более чем в два раза и не требует специальных знаний для установки и настройки. ПАК «Умный шлагбаум» может применяться в бюджетной сфере (школы, детские сады, больницы), на режимных объектах и частных территориях. «Эдж Вижн» — простые транспортные решения для умных городов Андрей Стародубцев рассказал о единой системе умной транспортной сети с использованием искусственного интеллекта для оптимизации светофорных объектов. Подключить систему можно на автономном перекрёстке или встроить её в сеть. При этом не нужно полностью менять существующие системы, а реализация отдельно взятого проекта занимает от двух недель. Спикер отметил, что его компания ищет, в первую очередь, стратегического партнёра. «Везубр» — логистическая система с набором микросервисов Том Ширинян представил проект по автоматизации и роботизации транспортной логистики. Решение предполагает единое облако взаимодействия, оптимизацию процессов и кастомизацию за счёт встроенных микросервисов. «Везубр» позволяет управлять всеми перевозками в режиме реального времени, а также автоматически передавать и получать необходимые данные. MONTRANS — цифровизация автопарка полного цикла: от R&D до сопровождения Дмитрий Журавлев представил решения для цифровизации автопарка. Сервис MONTRANS позволяет контролировать топливо и полезную нагрузку, отслеживать состояние транспорта и водителя и другие показатели. Всё это экономит время персонала, сокращает закупки техники и пресекает махинации, а главное — повышает эффективность автопарка и безопасность вождения. NAVIDU — сервис мониторинга транспорта Павел Тюменев выступил с презентацией сервиса мониторинга транспорта, который собирает данные с бортовых устройств и систем, а также видеокамер, автоматически уведомляет о событиях, анализирует поведение водителя и состояние груза, контролирует перемещение. Часть функций уже работает, часть пока находится в пилотном режиме. Команда проекта заинтересована в инвестициях для выхода на новые рынки и доработки своего продукта. «Космотехтранс» — программно-алгоритмический комплекс контроля и управления совместными полетами пилотируемой и беспилотной авиации в общем воздушном пространстве Александр Ильин поднял проблему контроля полётов беспилотников. Предложенная им концепция в корне отличается от традиционной — диспетчерский контроль предлагается заменить на автоматизированный, а диспетчера превратить в оператора. По словам спикера, такой подход успешно применяется по всему миру в других областях, и именно он лёг в основу разработки компании «Космотехтранс». График ближайших мероприятий в 2021 году: 2 декабря — медтехника, медуслуги, фарма.

Комментировали представленные стартапы эксперты по международному сотрудничеству из различных институций, а также члены и бизнес-послы «Деловой России». Член генсовета «Деловой России» и председатель клуба Денис Дидковский поблагодарил участников за поддержку нового формата и рассказал, как он появился: «Традиционно клуб рассчитан на отрасли и российских участников, но у нас поступили запросы от стартапов по налаживанию международных связей. Формат экспортного клуба позволяет стартапам и предпринимателям эффективно оценить перспективы своего товара или услуги на внешних рынках, быстро наладить деловые связи. Бизнес-послы \"Деловой России\" обладают прекрасным знанием своих стран присутствия и готовы оказать поддержку российским стартапам» . В начале встречи вице-президент и руководитель исполкома «Деловой России» Нонна Каграманян рассказала о возможностях института бизнес-послов: «Это 47 человек, 47 стран, в которых у нас есть свои представительства. Это предприниматели, которые понимают барьеры и проблемы, с которыми может столкнуться бизнес в определенной стране. Они могут помогать продвигаться на новые рынки» . Участники встречи представили шесть проектов и обозначили свои ожидания относительно поиска партнеров и инвесторов. Денис Захаркин рассказал о программном обеспечении для коллективного виртуального прототипирования VR Concept. Это решение заменяет инструменты коммуникации такие, как Zoom, и позволяет снизить стоимость и время на проектирование и прототипирование на 15–30%. Кирилл Партала представил компанию BID Technologies, которая запустила полный цикл производства промышленных роботов с искусственным интеллектом в Ярославле. Компания создает роботов под совершенно разные нужды, спектр возможностей очень широк, однако Кирилл Партала отметил, что в перспективе компания хотела бы сузить специализацию. Для этого она планирует выйти на международный рынок, потому что в России спрос достаточно ограничен. Презентация Ильи Борищева была посвящена реабилитационному тренажеру на основе нейроинтерфейса Vibraint RehUp. Это устройство стимулирует нейропластичность — способность мозга выстраивать новые нейросвязи взамен разрушенных после инсульта. Компания ищет производственных партнеров и задумывается о выходе на экспорт. Алексей Немченко представил дыхательный тренажер «САМОЗДРАВ», принцип действия которого основан на естественной физиологической методике, помогающей восстановить кровоснабжение всех жизненно важных органов. Тренажер в первую очередь может использоваться для лечения сердечно-сосудистой и дыхательной систем, а также в составе комплексной терапии при некоторых других заболеваниях. Еще одной темой заседания клуба стал транспорт. Илья Федичев рассказал о проекте MEGAVATT компании «Электротранспортные технологии» — производстве беспилотных электрических грузовиков. Компания ищет партнеров (в первую очередь в ОАЭ) и заказчиков. У компании уже есть несколько реализованных проектов: беспилотный электробус «Матрёшка», его грузовой вариант, а также беспилотные грузовые платформы. Последним выступил Алексей Ирков с проектом EMBLE — высокоточной системой неинвазивной диагностики внутренних органов с помощью нейросети. EMBLE применяется для диагностики заболеваний лошадей и в сравнении с другими методами обходится дешевле, работает быстрее и является более безопасным для животного. Компания ищет инвестиции и планирует запустить пилотный проект на Ближнем Востоке к концу 2020 года. Представленные проекты активно комментировали советник бизнес-посла «Деловой России» в ОАЭ, руководитель представительства бизнес-посла в Дубае Алладин Зоуроб; руководитель отдела международного сотрудничества Фонда «Сколково» Лина Абу Мух Зоаби; руководитель экспертной группы Российско-Израильского Делового Совета Игорь Беренштейн и эксперт медицинских проектов Российско-Израильского Делового Совета Виктор Монич. Мероприятия Startup-клуба в аналогичном формате будут проходить ежеквартально. Они будут посвящены отдельным рынкам: Европе, Азии, СНГ, Африке и другим. «Мы рассчитываем, что с помощью бизнес-послов и стартапов нам удастся укрепить не только положение отдельных компаний на рынке, но и экономику нашей страны», — отметила Нонна Каграманян.

Очень благодарен «Деловой России» за возможность поучаствовать в данном мероприятии и уверен, что наше сотрудничество на этом не остановится». В рамках встречи было рассмотрено пять проектов, четыре из которых специализируются на роботизации производства и процессов и один проект направлен на совершенствование индустрии профессионального спорта и развлечений. Первым выступил Михаил Григорьев, руководитель проекта Grinik Robotics, производящей российские промышленные роботы. Заказчиками являются заводы по производству пластиковых изделий и изделий из металла, заводы по производству мебели и различной фурнитуры, складские комплексы и лаборатории, а также другие производства с тяжелым, опасным или рутинным трудом. Михаил Григорьев подчеркнул, что приоритетным направлением развития по-прежнему остается российский рынок, но его команда также смотрит в сторону Европы, Южной и Северной Америки. Денис Захаркин представил VR Concept, приложение виртуального прототипирования для коллективной работы с цифровыми двойниками в виртуальной реальности. По просьбе одного из участников руководитель проекта объяснил принцип использования технологии на примере конкретного предприятия, осуществляющего полный цикл производства сидений всех классов для пассажиров. С помощью программного обеспечения VR Concept на встрече с партнерами или потенциальными клиентами, надев шлем виртуальной реальности, можно, не выходя из офиса, увидеть конкретные решения исполнителя, например, сидения, их комплектацию, цвет. Более того, ПО позволяет не только интегрировать в VR-пространство продукт, но и показать, как реальные люди будут этим пользоваться. Основатель Aripix Robotics Андрей Спиридонов развивает проект в области промышленной робототехники. Шестиосевой робот-манипулятор служит для организации массовой роботизации и увеличения производительности труда на предприятиях, заводах и фабриках. Команде проекта удалось изменить стандартную кинематическую схему шарнирного робота, за счет чего значительно упростились управление и математика движения робота. BID Technologies, умные промышленные роботы, представил Кирилл Партала. На данный момент среди роботов выделяются шестиосевые, линейные, дельта-роботы и scara. Они имеют самые разные сферы применения, например, используются для переработки лекарственных средств, диагностики лопаток турбин, для умной сварки, сортировки батареек, упаковки кондитерской продукции или мешков и коробок на паллеты. Генеральный директор ООО «Кука Раша» Дмитрий Капишников поинтересовался, за счет чего стоимость шестиосевого робота ниже, чем у конкурентов. Кирилл Партала уточнил, что в компании в процессе проектирования коллаборативных роботов научились применять армированные пластики и начали печатать большую часть деталей на 3D-принтерах, достигли организации производства и работы робота с грузоподъемностью до 5 кг за счет напечатанных деталей. Завершил питч-сессию Владислав Кузнецов с презентацией роботизированного тренировочного комплекса для футболистов FOOTBOT. Комплекс организован таким образом, что мячи вылетают с разной скоростью, по разной траектории, под разными углами непрерывно, цикл полностью автоматизирован, что позволяет спортсменам полноценно тренироваться без остановки. Кроме того, система анализирует точность ударов, быстроту работы с мячом, уровень прогресса игрока, что впоследствии дает возможность сформировать индивидуальный план тренировок. Предложение по развитию проекта последовало от исполнительного директора Национальной Ассоциации участников рынка робототехники Алисы Конюховской, которая увидела возможность продвижения комплекса на площадках фитнес-центровю. Она отметила, что для фитнес-индустрии внедрение подобной технологии может быть уникальным решением в рамках индивидуальных тренировок. По окончании обсуждения Алиса Конюховская предложила продолжить сотрудничество и помочь с контактами различных ассоциаций, которые могут быть полезны для развития проекта. «В России много интересных и сильных робо-проектов. Данное мероприятие это наглядно продемонстрировало.

Экспертную поддержку получили шесть проектов. Встречу открыла директор департамента корпоративного развития «Деловой России» Ольга Алёшина. «Startup клуб создан в марте 2020 года и зарекомендовал себя как полезный и продуктивный формат для разных отраслей. Мы смотрим на тенденции и отрасли, которые волнуют и интересуют членов “Деловой России”» , — отметила она. Во встрече приняли участие 11 членов генсовета «Деловой России»: Давид Якобашвили, Владимир Алгинин, Андрей Грибенюк, Антон Жеребцов, Айнур Айдельдинов, Валерий Калюжный, Максим Загорнов, Наталья Кириллова, Дмитрий Чухланцев, Михаил Замарин, Алексей Шатров. Модератором встречи выступила заместитель директора Института исследований и экспертизы Внешэкономбанка Юлия Зворыкина. Участники представили шесть проектов. «Рециклизат» — организация инновационного производства по повторному применению каучукосодержащих продуктов Кирилл Васильев представил решение для рециклинга резинотехнических изделий, с применением инновационных технологий, которое позволяет вернуть изделие в исходное состояние — каучуковую смесь. Продукт рециклинга может применяться при изготовлении базовой технической резины, качественной вторичной резины и модифицируемого битума. Проект подходит под статус «зелёного» по всем параметрам. Команда проекта заинтересована в инвестициях. «Группа МЭС» — разработка и создание пилотного комплекса утилизации ТБО с экологически чистым процессом получения тепло-электроэнергии и строительных материалов Андрей Болконский представил проект, который направлен на безотходную и экологически чистую утилизацию ТБО, отказ от захоронения отходов на мусорных полигонах, а также на повышение энергобезопасности регионов на основе возобновляемых источников энергии. Кроме приема ТБО на утилизацию, комплекс подразумевает реализацию тепловой энергии, электрической энергии и стройматериалов. Команда проекта заинтересована в участии «мусорной реформе» и обратилась к экспертам за помощью с выходом на органы государственной власти. «Сибирский биоуголь» — технологический комплекс по производству древесно-угольного брикета из отходов лесопиления Проект, который представил Гарик Гаспарян, предполагает уникальную технологию для переработки отходов лесопиления в твёрдые продукты, предназначенные для генерации тепловой энергии в различных сферах народного потребления с высокими показателями энергоёмкости. С экспертами Гарик Гаспарян обсудил ключевые требования и пожелания компаний — потенциальных заказчиков при приобретении предлагаемого завода по переработке отходов лесопиления «под ключ». «Биотех» — комплекс по переработке древесных отходов Денис Чекашкин рассказал о проекте, который решает проблему переработки лигнина (вещества, характеризующего одеревеневшие стенки растительных клеток) Канского биохимического завода и отходов лесопиления. Сегодня нет ни одного такого же решения замкнутого цикла для переработки отходов лесопиления и производства экологически чистого бездымного топлива. Проект подразумевает три основных продукта, а также побочные продукты — тепловую и электроэнергию. Проект нуждается в господдержке, а также рассчитывает на сокращение сроков процедур, связанных с предоставлением земельных участков. «Умная SREDA» — изделия для благоустройства из вторсырья на основе полимерпесчаной технологии Александра Кроун представила сеть экозаводов, специализирующихся на переработке вторичных материалов из смешанного пластика и производстве из него экологически безопасных строительных материалов и малых архитектурных форм для благоустройства. Продукция заводов может применяться при благоустройстве современных дворовых территорий, территорий компаний и предприятий, социально значимых объектов, городских территорий и дачных участков. Компания заинтересована во всесторонней поддержке – от информационной до финансовой, – а также ищет возможности выхода на европейский рынок и рынок Ближнего Востока. «Рецикл» — производство биотоплива Евгений Пантелеев выступил с презентацией проекта по созданию демонстрационного производства биодизельного топлива «Пермское» в объеме 20 тыс. тонн в год совместно с инвестором. Топливо отличается низкой себестоимостью, высоким качеством и широкой сырьевой базой. Его основное преимущество перед аналогами — улучшение выхлопа дизельных двигателей: при замене солярки на биодизель концентрация окислов азота уменьшилась в 6,5 раз, а дымность уменьшилась в 1,65 раза. Команда проекта ищет, в первую очередь, инвестора. График ближайших мероприятий в 2021 году: 7 октября — проекты в сфере городской инфраструктуры и ЖКХ.

Кроме того, осенью этого года ScaleUp вошла в перечень рекомендованных Минэкономразвития РФ обучающих программ для подготовки предпринимателей малого и среднего бизнеса, а также тех, кто планирует начать предпринимательскую деятельность. Полный курс обучения по программе ScaleUp платный и занимает 9 месяцев. «До конца года благодаря поддержке Правительства Московской области жители 10 городских округов бесплатно пройдут 16-часовой интерактивный курс по финансовой грамотности и стратегии бизнеса, ― отметил Денис Дидковский, генеральный директор ООО «Центр предпринимательства». ― Обучение по уникальной методике, объединившей в себе лучшие отечественные и мировые практики развития бизнеса, проводят сертифицированные бизнес-тренеры, специально отобранные Центром предпринимательства с учетом работы с аудиторией разного уровня подготовки: от студентов и тех, у кого нет опыта ведения своего дела, но есть желание начать, до опытных предпринимателей, которые пришли за новыми идеями и решениями». Бизнес-тренеры программы: Екатерина Васильева специализируется на стратегическом и операционном управлении. Алия Кусепгалиева занимается развитием лидеров в глобальных компаниях как фасилитатор лидерских программ, оценки и развития, и как коуч руководителей. Специализируется на индивидуальном и командном коучинге, оценке компетенций, управлении талантами и эффективностью. Ирина Оленбергер занимается разработкой программ и проведением курсов и семинаров для предпринимателей и клиентов Сбербанка по финансовому и управленческому учету, а также оптимизации бухгалтерского и налогового учета. Все спикеры имеют опыт предпринимательской деятельности и за два дня интенсива разбирают с участниками реальные бизнес-кейсы, дают практические задания и ценные рекомендации по созданию и развитию бизнеса. В один из дней бизнес-тренеры рассказывают о важности стратегического планирования и факторах, влияющих на развитие бизнеса, а также обучают проводить анализ сильных и слабых сторон предприятия и определять пути решения для выхода из сложных ситуаций. На занятиях, посвященных финансовой грамотности, слушатели узнают о кассовом методе ведения бизнеса, изучают оборотные активы и основные финансовые коэффициенты, учатся анализировать причины проблем роста бизнеса, минимизировать затраты, а также планировать и управлять денежными потоками. Программа уже получила множество положительных откликов от участников. Так, например, Вероника Семилетова, студентка Дмитровского института непрерывного образования, поделилась впечатлениями после занятия в Дмитрове: «Я пришла на курс, потому что планирую открыть в Дмитрове салон красоты. Спасибо тренерам за то, что буквально открыли глаза на многие вопросы по ведению своего дела. Я и не предполагала, что в корне каждого бизнеса свои правила игры, правовые основы, методы продвижения и отчетность». В каждом городе своя уникальная атмосфера: где-то приходят активные студенты, уже начавшие или планирующие открыть свое дело, а где-то ― пенсионеры, желая повысить уровень знаний в области учета своих расходов и финансового планирования. Отдельно отметим двухдневный курс в городе Орехово-Зуево, где сформировано небольшое предпринимательское сообщество, которое активно взаимодействует с Центром «Мой бизнес» и участвуют в различных семинарах, тренингах, форумах, оказывая поддержку друг другу на разных этапах ведения бизнеса. Здесь наставники Центра предпринимательства столкнулись с наибольшим интересом участников к теме и, в особенности, к практической части обучения. Предприниматели задавали множество вопросов, дискутировали, вместе проводили бизнес-разборы и давали друг другу ценные рекомендации. На сегодняшний день при поддержке Правительства Московской области, Минэкономразвития России, Министерства инвестиций и инноваций, а также Центра оказания услуг «Мой бизнес» проведено обучение в Можайске, Ногинске, Орехово-Зуеве, Реутове, Дмитрове, Солнечногорске, Коломне, Красногорске и Королеве. В декабре бизнес-тренеры встретятся со всеми желающими в Люберцах и еще раз в Реутове и Можайске. Присоединиться к обучению бесплатно можно после предварительной регистрации по ссылке . Уже 732 участника курса получили сертификат о прохождении образовательной программы «Повышение уровня финансовой грамотности и обучение основам ведения бизнеса». Всего по программе планируется обучить не менее 1000 человек.

В рамках мероприятия состоялась также премодерация проектов  в области искусственного интеллекта для предстоящего заседания Инвестиционного клуба «Деловой России». «Я рад, что сегодня мы проводим мероприятие в рамках программы Startup Huddle совместно с  «Деловой Россией». Стартапы смогут получить экспертную оценку и рекомендации по дальнейшим шагам в своем деле от присутствующих сегодня в качестве экспертов опытных предпринимателей, членов генерального и координационного советов  «Деловой России», директора института Внешэкономбанка, инвесторов, представителей Минэкономразвития и ряда корпораций. Стартапы для сегодняшнего мероприятия отобраны в основном из сферы искусственного интеллекта, многие, в том числе, от нашего партнера отраслевого союза «Нейронет». Члены «Деловой России» также представят свои проекты, наработки и новые бизнесы инвестиционному и развивающемуся стартап сообществам», ― заметил Денис Дидковский, генеральный директор ООО  «Центр предпринимательства», член генсовета «Деловой России». Стандартный формат мероприятия в рамках международной программы Startup Huddle подразумевает выступления до 4-х участников, но в этот раз, ввиду сложившейся для бизнеса ситуации, было принято решение рассмотреть сразу 9 проектов. Модератором мероприятия выступил исполнительный директор отраслевого союза «Нейронет» Александр Семенов. Открыл питч-сессию Алексей Винокуров с презентацией проекта Reyou, направленного на диагностику и последующее восстановление когнитивных функций пользователя. В течение сеанса в капсульном кресле осуществляется анализ деятельности сердечных и дыхательных функций человека. Аналитика больших данных по функциональному состоянию пользователя позволяет искусственному интеллекту создать персонифицированную программу, отвечающую требованиям текущего состояния клиента. Эксперты обсудили с Алексеем Винокуровым преимущества и особенности решения, а также рассмотрели возможности запуска серийного производства и реализации на других рынках. О системе предиктивной аналитики, направленной на сокращение затрат в фермерских хозяйствах, рассказал руководитель проекта Trideo Максим Гришин. Данная система позволяет прогнозировать: необходимость полива, удобрения сельхозугодий, показывать необходимость сбора урожая, качество почвы. Проект основан на принципах ИИ при принятии решений за человека, позволяет снизить на 30% затраты и повысить урожайность. Вниманию экспертов был также представлен проект Персонатика Алексея Добрусина. Идея состоит в создании образовательного маркетплейса, площадки для онлайн-обучения, которая благодаря разрабатываемому сейчас командой алгоритму, будет собирать курсы с различных сервисов, комбинировать их и выдавать пользователю отвечающие его запросу рекомендации. Индивидуальная образовательная траектория на основе Big Data позволит ученикам максимально быстро и эффективно достичь необходимых результатов, а для партнеров это станет дополнительным каналом продаж. Не меньший интерес вызвали проекты других участников. Так, Андрей Гершун рассказал об особенностях разрабатываемой программы Whatify, предназначенной для стратегического планирования и выстраивания оптимальных цепей поставок. Интерактивный визуальный интерфейс программы облегчает оценку и анализ расчетов, позволяя повысить оперативность реакции на различные изменения на рынке. Руководитель стартапа Архангел Алексей Алтухов отметил, что развивает проект по созданию электрического крыла вертикального взлета и посадки в качестве транспортного средства, а не развлекательного объекта. Технологии искусственного интеллекта должны помочь разработать решение для осуществления перевозки грузов и возможности перехода из вертикального положения в горизонтальное во время полета. Филипп Жучков выступил с проектом психодиагностики человека по фото SCANFACE. Он рассказал о дальнейших планах по продвижению данного решения и привлечению инвестиций, а также грамотному позиционированию на рынке. Максим Политов представил систему предиктивной аналитики AWTOR. Продукт позволяет технологическим компаниям снизить затраты и время на разработку новой продукции, оптимизировать производственные процессы и создавать продукты с принципиально новыми потребительскими качествами. Алексей Шатров провел презентацию системы предиктивного управления городской инфраструктурой и объектами недвижимости. Проект направлен на повышение энергоэффективности экономики страны. Вне основной программы также выступил кандидат физико-математических наук, доцент кафедры экономической информатики МГУ Сергей Тищенко, представив  собравшимся научно-исследовательскую работу по сетевому контролю инфекционных заболеваний в России на примере текущей ситуации с коронавирусом. Исследователь заявил, что эффективное сдерживание массового распространения COVID-19 без остановки экономической деятельности участников рынка возможно. Он поделился видением этапов выхода из сложившейся ситуации. «Благодаря объединению усилий «Деловой России» и Центра предпринимательства, направленных на оказание поддержки представителям бизнеса, удалось провести масштабную онлайн-сессию, которая открыла нам ряд интересных проектов, ― сказал Александр Масленников, член Генерального совета  «Деловой России». ― Многие из тех, кто сегодня выступил в рамках программы Startup Huddle примут участие в предстоящей онлайн-встрече Инвестиционного клуба «Деловой России». Тем, кто получил от экспертов рекомендации по доработке и улучшению представленных решений, мы поможем подготовиться и выйти в дальнейшем с достойным предложением к инвесторам».

Сетевая тиражируемая программа для МСП «Развитие и акселерация малого бизнеса через предпринимательское наставничество и партнерство с крупными компаниями» была разработана Центром предпринимательства для системного развития малого бизнеса на основе лучших российских и международных практик акселерации малого бизнеса и развития предпринимательских экосистем. Она прошла предварительный отбор, проведенный Агентством стратегических инициатив к Форуму «Сильные идеи для нового времени». Ранее программа реализовывалась Центром предпринимательства во Владимирской, Кировской, Воронежской, Нижегородской, Тюменской, Томской, Ростовской и Калининградской областях, Краснодарском крае и Республике Марий Эл, где показала стабильные и высокие результаты. В данных регионах приняли участие более 230 собственников бизнеса, годовой оборот которых впоследствии вырос в среднем на 53%. Партнерство с ОПОРОЙ РОССИИ позволит тиражировать программу в большем количестве регионов, используя потенциал региональных отделений ОПОРЫ РОССИИ. Программа позволит развивать бизнес участников через механизм наставничества, при этом в качестве наставников выступают опытные предприниматели. Анна Белова, председатель Наблюдательного совета Центра предпринимательства: «Программа поддержки малого бизнеса в условиях неопределенности внешней среды вследствие турбулентности в экономике, в том числе, из-за распространения коронавируса, является знаковой и важной инициативой Центра предпринимательства. Совместная договоренность Центра предпринимательства и ОПОРЫ РОССИИ о развитии проекта крайне своевременна. Проект направлен на создание комплекса системных мер и подходов, позволяющего поддержать малый бизнес, с участием наставников из среднего бизнеса и крупных корпораций» . Наталья Золотых, вице-президент ОПОРЫ РОССИИ: « Я уверена, что данный проект, основанный на стратегическом партнерстве Центра предпринимательства с крупнейшей организацией поддержки малого предпринимательства ОПОРА РОССИИ, является масштабный инициативой, которая в случае поддержки Агентством стратегических инициатив позволит реализовать эффективные механизмы поддержки малого бизнеса через предпринимательское наставничество. Это очень своевременная инициатива, по моему мнению, будет востребована, как в регионах, так и в Москве, и Санкт-Петербурге. Для этого есть все основания – методология, опыт, сплоченная команда российских и зарубежных экспертов и, конечно же, настоятельная необходимость развития механизмов акселерации малого бизнеса, способных преодолеть сложности современного этапа экономического развития малых компаний».

Такие собрания всегда позволяют посмотреть на то, что ты делаешь со стороны и найти новые идеи для развития своего дела, ― поделилась Елена Угольникова. ― Рада, что смогла сегодня присоединиться к заседанию Бизнес-клуба. Люди, с которыми я познакомилась, меня тепло приняли, выслушали и поделились действительно рабочими решениями. Я поняла, что что смогу осуществить свои бизнес-задачи быстрее и проще». Член Бизнес-клуба Агуреева Мария поддержала обсуждение специфики организации клиентских мероприятий, представив компанию «Открытое пространство», специализирующуюся на проведении ежедневных тематических мастер-классов для людей всех возрастов. По ее словам, за неделю организация может провести более 70 событий. О получении гранта на реализацию проекта и своем опыте подготовки мероприятий разной степени сложности Мария Агуреева рассказала членам Клуба. В рамках дискуссии участники отметили важность активного освещения происходящих мероприятий в социальных сетях, а также задумались об эффективности такого подхода в отношении привлечения новых клиентов. Медиа-эксперт Бизнес-клуба ScaleUp Антон Климов предложил собравшимся несколько стратегий по продвижению своего бизнеса и ведения аккаунтов в социальных сетях. Непосредственно на встрече участники с помощью смартфонов сделали несколько шагов под чутким руководством эксперта и научились анализировать аудиторию подписчиков, а также отслеживать результативность своих действий. Антон Климов в индивидуальном порядке обсудил с членами Клуба опыт работы каждого с интернет-аудиторией, способы внедрения ненавязчивой рекламы, методы работы с лидерами мнений и тренды отрасли. Участники договорились применить полученные знания и навыки в работе и собраться снова 13 апреля для рассмотрения полученных результатов и обсуждения дальнейших действий.

Центр предпринимательства совместно с ООО «БИСС» разработал уникальную тестовую методику выявления предрасположенностей к предпринимательским навыкам и компетенциям, которая основывается на передовых российских и международных исследованиях в области оценки предпринимательского менталитета и предпринимательских качеств. Задача тестового опроса состоит в изучении мотивационной сферы, личностных качеств, а также анализа предпринимательского потенциала. До 15 декабря все желающие имеют возможность пройти бесплатное комплексное тестирование по ссылке http://predu.ru/test.html .

В случае, если участник не имеет возможности присутствовать, он может подготовить эссе с описанием действующего или планируемого к реализации бизнеса, а также записать видеообращение. Получившие высокие оценки экспертной комиссии, свидетельствующие о перспективности и проработанности бизнес-идеи, будут направлены в центры «Мой бизнес» для последующей работы по реализации их планов.

В рамках реализации нацпроекта «Малое и среднее предпринимательство и поддержка индивидуальной предпринимательской инициативы» Центр предпринимательства совместно с ООО «БИСС», опираясь на передовые международные исследования в области оценки предпринимательского менталитета и предпринимательских качеств, разработал тестовый опрос. Его задача ― выявить у учащихся предрасположенность к предпринимательским навыкам и компетенциям. По результатам тестирования были отобраны 40 молодых людей с наиболее высокой степенью мотивации и выраженными способностями к предпринимательской деятельности. Участников разделили на 4 команды, каждая из которых представляла собой предприятие, а учащиеся выступали его сотрудниками. Перед ними стояла задача составить бизнес-план и предложить инновационный продукт под реализацию. Бизнес-идеи были самыми разными: от цветочного горшка с установленной системой автополива с заданным временем включения до курток, которые получают тепло от смартфона посредством приложения и согревают владельца. В состав экспертной комиссии вошли лица с опытом в сфере поддержки и развития предпринимательства. Они оценивали перспективность представленного проекта и уровень его проработанности, а также давали молодым людям ценные рекомендации по факторам влияния, которые также следует учитывать в предпринимательской деятельности. «Благодаря уникальной тестовой методике выявления предрасположенностей к предпринимательским навыкам и компетенциям у обучающихся уже сложилось некоторое представление о личных сильных чертах. Наряду с возможностью  примерить на себя определенную профессиональную роль и в результате  совместной работы  с коллегами прийти к намеченной цели эти мероприятия позволяют молодым людям определить для себя дальнейший вектор своего развития», ― отметила Михайлюк Алина Вадимовна, член экспертной комиссии, преподаватель, ГБОУ школа №2103.

ВНП в России проводится Центром предпринимательства при поддержке Минэкономразвития России, АНО «Агентство стратегических инициатив по продвижению новых проектов», общероссийской общественной организации малого и среднего предпринимательства «ОПОРА РОССИИ» и общероссийской общественной организации «Деловая Россия». В 2019 году, благодаря поддержке Минэкономразвития РФ в регионах, в акцию включились более 420 организаторов из 62 регионов России, было проведено более 500 мероприятий, объединивших около 253 000 человек. ВНП проходит в более 180 странах мира, чтобы дать предпринимателям возможность рассказать как о своих достижениях и успехах, так и обсудить пути преодоления возникших сложностей, быть услышанными сообществом, правительствами разных стран, напомнить о важности развития предпринимательства в мире, что, по словам председателя наблюдательного совета ООО «Центр предпринимательства», члена экспертного совета «Агентства стратегических инициатив по продвижению новых проектов», заместителя председателя совета директоров ПАО АФК «Система» Анны Беловой, меняет отношение к предпринимательству в целом: «Это изменение понимания, что такое предприниматели и культура предпринимательства. И в этом смысле Россия может дать совершенно новый сигнал в мир – реальный шанс сказать, что за этот год у нас произошло сразу несколько знаковых изменений: законодательные поправки о молодежном предпринимательстве, снижение возраста для предпринимателей, появление представителя по молодежному предпринимательству». Генеральный директор «Центра предпринимательства» Денис Дидковский напомнил, что Всемирная неделя предпринимательства проводится в России уже в 13-й раз. «Очень рад, что в 2020 году наш проект уже в девятый раз поддержан Министерством экономического развития Российской Федерации, — отметил он также. - Мы предлагаем использовать формат [недели предпринимательства], чтобы общественные организации, отраслевые объединения, предприниматели говорили о своих успехах и планах, которые сегодня вдвойне важны, чтобы в трудную минуту поддержать коллег по цеху и предложить актуальные инициативы» . Денис Дидковский представил краткую программу недели в Москве: 17 ноября день будет посвящен экспорту, 18 ноября — образованию предпринимателей, 19 ноября — стартапам, 20 ноября — бизнесу на Дальнем востоке, «Международный день импорта и экспорта 2020» также проходит в рамках Всемирной недели предпринимательства. Как отметил президент Общероссийской общественной организации малого и среднего предпринимательства «Опора России» Александр Калинин, предпринимательство само по себе является большой ценностью для любой страны и общества, так как предприниматели создают товары и услуги, повышают качество и фактически определяют уровень в стране. «Чем больше будет предпринимателей, тем сильнее и эффективнее является та или иная страна. На мой взгляд, надо делиться опытом с другими странами. Чем во многом и занимается Центр предпринимательства и во многом оказывают содействие нам национальные проекты – это находится в фокусе внимания руководства нашей страны» , - подчеркнул Александр Калинин. «Если мы не будем объединять усилия в той работе, которая необходима предпринимателям, мы очень серьезно можем оказаться в аутсайдерах. А поиск прорывных форматов и направлений — это очень серьезная необходимость в экономиках любых стран» , — подчеркнула в своем приветствии вице-президент, руководитель исполкома «Деловой России» Нонна Каграманян. По ее словам, в программе недели предпринимательства запланированы несколько событий с участием «Деловой России»: по экспорту, по «зеленой» экономике и другим темам. «Мероприятия, которые планируются в рамках ВНП — хороший шанс для нас объединиться, понять где мы находимся и определить, где мы будем через определенное количество времени. Нам необходимо перспективное, долгосрочное планирование, чтобы, отбирая и сопровождая проекты, мы понимали, как мы могли бы укрепить экономику нашей страны и активизировать взаимодействие с нашими партнерами за рубежом» , — подытожила вице-президент «Деловой России».

В первых числах декабря обучение прошли студенты и преподаватели ГБПОУ МО «Гидрометеорологический техникум». Центр оказания услуг «Мой бизнес» заранее проинформировал участников о возможности в рамках нацпроекта «Малое и среднее предпринимательства и поддержка индивидуальной предпринимательской инициативы» пройти бесплатно обучение по программе «Повышение уровня финансовой грамотности и обучение основам ведения бизнеса». В основу курса легли учебные модули разработанной Центром предпринимательства акселерационной программы ScaleUp. Для обучения действующих и будущих предпринимателей по отлично зарекомендовавшей себя методике решением Министерства инвестиций и инноваций и АНО «Агентство инвестиционного развития Московской области» были отобраны 2 учебных модуля программы ScaleUp. «Я пришла на обучение вместе с мужем. У нас семейный бизнес по производству пряников. До прохождения интенсива даже мыслей не было о получении патента или возможности отдать продукцию под реализацию. Тренеры программы провели детальный бизнес-разбор, помогли определить новые пути развития и указали на возможные риски. За два дня мы получили новые инструменты работы и познакомились с другими предпринимателями города. Всегда была интересно узнать, кто и чем занимается в нашем местном предпринимательском сообществе. Земляки должны поддерживать друг друга!», ― поделилась Мария Крашеникова, ООО «Богородский пряник». По словам Тяговой Ларисы Владимировны, заместителя директора по учебной части ГБПОУ МО «Гидрометеорологический техникум», администрация образовательного учреждения пригласила бизнес-тренеров Центра предпринимательства в виду того, что в учебный план была включена новая дисциплина по формированию предпринимательских компетенций у молодых людей. Педагоги сошлись во мнении, что студентам лучше узнать о стратегии бизнеса и финансовом учете от сертифицированных тренеров с опытом предпринимательской деятельности. Екатерина Васильева, бизнес-тренер по стратегическому и операционному управлению, объяснила слушателям, что курс имеет практическую ценность в том числе и для тех, кто не планирует открывать свое дело: «Инструментарий, который мне даем на занятиях по стратегическому планированию применим не только в отношении бизнеса. Умение проводить анализ и оценивать риски поможет смело двигаться к намеченной цели и достигать ее. Уже наличие корректно сформулированной цели является половиной успеха». Студенты активно участвовали в разборах реальных кейсов и вместе с тренерами продумывали свои идеи для бизнеса. В техникуме сообщили, что в рамках новой дисциплины молодые люди займутся составлением бизнес-планов. Благодаря пройденному курсу обучения у них есть все необходимые для этого знания. Равно как и преподаватели теперь понимают критерии оценивания и готовы оказать поддержку на всех этапах работы над проектом.

На этот раз занятия по финансовой грамотности и стратегии бизнеса при поддержке Правительства Московской области бесплатно проводились для студентов ГБПОУ МО «Ногинский колледж», обучающихся по специальностям «Банковское дело» и «Экономика и бухгалтерский учет». «Администрация Ногинского колледжа активно занимается формированием и развитием предпринимательских навыков обучающихся посредством реализации ряда программ, которые в свою очередь повышают уровень мотивации молодых людей к профессиональному самоопределению, ― отметил Денис Дидковский, генеральный директор ООО «Центр предпринимательства». ― На базе колледжа организован специализированный центр компетенций Worldskills Russia, проводятся конкурсы профессионального мастерства, областные чемпионаты и фестивали молодежных проектов по развитию предпринимательства. В этом году Ногинский колледж также провел мероприятия в рамках Всемирной недели предпринимательства, глобальной международной инициативы, которая прошла в нашей стране по инициативе Центра предпринимательства и при поддержке Минэкономразвития России. А теперь студентам представилась возможность пройти 16-часовой интерактивный курс по финансовому и стратегическому управлению, в основу которого легли учебные модули акселерационной программы ScaleUp».

Колледж создает студентам все условия для прохождения производственной практики на предприятиях по осваиваемой специализации.

Встреча со стартапами прошла в формате международной программы Startup Huddle, оператором которой в России является Центр предпринимательства. В ходе мероприятия особое внимание было уделено технологическим решениям и проектам, направленным на борьбу с COVID-19. Всего было 7 презентаций. Прямая трансляция события велась на странице Центра предпринимательства в Facebook. Модератором встречи выступил Дмитрий Ягодкин, эксперт по инвестиционной привлекательности и региональным институтам развития, член экспертного совета Национального рейтинга инвестиционной привлекательности РФ. Перед разбором кейсов было проведено установочное заседание Startup клуба, на котором Денис Дидковский, генеральный директор ООО  «Центр предпринимательства», совместно с Нонной Каграманян, вице-президентом, руководителем Исполнительного комитета «Деловой России», договорились придерживаться установленного формата проведения встреч в рамках клуба и определи круг актуальных тем для последующих мероприятий и экспертной работы. Михаил Югай, первый заместитель генерального директора Фонда международного медицинского кластера, взял слово перед стартом питч-сессии, чтобы рассказать участникам о возможностях организации: «Медицина является нашим основным фокусом внимания и сегодня мы наблюдаем определенный разрыв между идеями стартапов и реальными потребностями рынка. Фонд готов помочь начинающим предпринимателям с оценкой перспективности их проектов на московском рынке и апробацией создаваемых продуктов. Кроме того, подчеркну, что у медицинского кластера  в Европе и юго-восточной Азии, а также в Америке, но в меньшей степени, есть партнеры, с которыми можно обсудить возможности доработки проектов для последующего выхода на локальный рынок. Такая практика международного обмена открывает стартапам хорошие перспективы для развития не только в России, но и на рынках других стран». Открыл питч-сессию Амин Идилов, представив ассистивный сервис дополненной реальности для реабилитации пациентов с парезом верхних конечностей Cerebrum MD. Пациент в игровой форме выполняет упражнения ЛФК в приложении сервиса для восстановления мелкой моторики. Элементы геймификации и дополненная реальность повышают эффективность терапии, сокращая время реабилитации на 20% и 30% в сравнении с электромиостимуляцией и ЛФК, соответственно. Компьютерное зрение и машинное обучение автоматически контролируют и персонализируют терапию, снижая участие врача-реабилитолога к минимуму, что позволяет проводить ее удаленно от медицинской организации. Владимир Ладыгин обратил внимание собравшихся на важность эффективных и безопасных условий для работы и отдыха, на создание которых направлен сервис комплексного мониторинга микроклимата помещений Climateguard. В его основе компактная и мобильная коробочка ― модульный климатический зонд ClimateGuard, который оценивает до 20 параметров среды. Модульная структура позволяет быстро адаптировать решение под различные требования. Таким образом, сегодня команда разрабатывает концепцию решения, которое позволит не только производить оценку климата, но и активно очищать воздух в отдельной небольшой зоне, например, на рабочем месте. Следующий участник Сергей Карамышев продемонстрировал портативный аппарат, генерирующей кислород за счет термокаталитической реакции, протекающей между компонентами состава в узком температурном диапазоне. Генератор кислорода предназначен для оказания помощи пациентам с бронхиальной астмой, хроническими заболеваниями легких и при отравлении газом. Аппарат позволяет снять приступы кашля и облегчить состояние заболевшего, в том числе и коронавирусом. Устройство может использоваться для проведения терапии в домашних условиях, на карантине, а также в малых сельских и производственных пунктах. Ирина Шилова выступила с презентацией цифровой медицинской платформы DocApp, которая была разработана для агрегации, хранения и передачи данных по защищенным каналам доступа. Проект соответствует основным мировым трендам развития цифровой медицины. Программная платформа не имеет аналогов на российском рынке. На сегодняшний день она полностью разработана и доступна как в мобильном приложении, так и в веб-версии. Последним проект в области медицины представил Илья Скоробогатов, рассказав о работе над решением для сбора данных о пациенте в домашних условиях. На данном этапе первичную диагностику обеспечивают электронный стетоскоп и мобильное приложение LAENECO. Интеллектуальная система анализирует полученные звуки и предупреждает пользователя о необходимости получить консультацию врача. В разработке находится индивидуальный браслет термометр-пульсоксиметр. Илья Мокшин выступил с презентацией агрегатора коммерческих парковок ParkPass вне основной программы. Проект функционирует и в ближайшие два года планирует подключить как минимум 150 коммерческих парковок. Универсальная технология безопасного двустороннего обмена данными через зашифрованный Bluetooth-канал позволяет быстро и удобно пользоваться приложением даже на подземных паркингах без доступа к интернету. В завершении питч-сесси Андрей Мясков представил городской цифровой акселератор CDA, направленный на системный запуск стартапов в Санкт-Петербурге и выразил готовность в предоставлении проектов своих участников для участия в последующих встречах Startup клуба. Александр Масленников, член генерального совета  «Деловой России», поблагодарил всех участников за представленные проекты и предложил Амину Идилову и Ирине Шиловой принять участие в предстоящем заседании Инвестиционного клуба, посвященном медицине. Подводя итоги встречи, генеральный директор ООО  «Центр предпринимательства» Денис Дидковский отметил: «Первая сессия в рамках  Startup клуба, как и ранее состоявшаяся в формате Startup Huddle премодерация проектов Инвестиционного клуба «Деловой России», прошла успешно и показала свою эффективность. Я рад, что коллеги поддерживают наше стремление в оказании поддержки стартапам через краудсорсинг новых идей, подходов и бизнес-инструментов с привлечением участников предпринимательской экосистемы. Уверен, что молодому бизнесу, заинтересованному в экспертной работе, особенно полезна обратная связь от действующих предпринимателей, членов «Деловой России», чьи практические рекомендации основаны, в первую очередь, на личном опыте». Следующая онлайн-встреча в рамках Startup клуба состоится 14 мая.

В своем приветственном слове генеральный директор Центра предпринимательства Денис Дидковский отметил, что работа площадки Всемирной недели предпринимательства на Дальнем Востоке важна, в том числе, и как инструмент поддержи стартапов. «Мы постарались обеспечить сегодня руководителям проектов присутствие отраслевых корпоративных заказчиков, предпринимателей и инвесторов, которые могут помочь в реализации проектов», - подчеркнул Денис Дидковский. Также о возможности практической поддержки и построению цепочки трансфера инвестиционных проектов на федеральный уровень упомянул и координатор инвестиционного клуба по Дальневосточному федеральному округу «Деловой России», президент ассоциации «Бизнес клуб «Авангард» Валерий Калюжный. «Дальней Восток достаточно удален от центра, поэтому мы стремимся создать практико-применительную площадку, где стартап-проекты будут сопровождаться экспертами. Это позволит создать непрерывную цепочку вывода на рынок новых технологий, товаров и услуг» . «Дальний Восток – один из регионов совершенно различных климатических зон и условий. Это место для внедрений технологий по экомониторингу, а также технологий необходимых в логистике, медицине и образовании» , - открыл мероприятие управляющий директор АНО АПИ Василий Потёмкин. По его словам, территория Дальнего Востока является уникальным глобальным полигоном для российской науки по запуску пилотов, а также местом работы значительного количества госкомпаний. Василий Потёмкин также поделился планами о создании офиса, который будет заниматься поиском перспективных технологий для внедрения на территории Дальнего Востока и способов их применения. Не менее важным в развитии Дальнего Востока является получение финансирования при поддержке регионов. «Необходимо составить пул проектов, который может получить финансирования – привлечь зеленые и устойчивые ресурсы для реализации проектов внешнего рынка» - отметила член общественного совета Министерства по развитию Дальнего Востока и Арктики Юлия Зворыкина. На данный момент на территории Дальнего Востока существует ряд перспективных направлений, которые надо развивать и поддерживать. В завершении мероприятия координатор программы ПОРА Андрей Иванов упомянул о необходимости реализации накопившегося портфеля проектов.

Мероприятие организовано в партнерстве Агентством стратегических инициатив и с Российской ассоциацией бизнес-образования. «Всемирная неделя предпринимательства проводится каждую третью неделю ноября уже в 13 раз в России и мире. В 2020 году стран-организаторов уже около 180. В России Неделя проводится Центром предпринимательства при поддержке Минэкономразвития России, АНО «Агентство стратегических инициатив по продвижению новых проектов», общероссийской общественной организации малого и среднего предпринимательства «ОПОРА РОССИИ» и общероссийской общественной организации «Деловая Россия». В 2019 году благодаря поддержке Минэкономразвития РФ в регионах, в акцию включились более 420 организаторов из 62 регионов России, было проведено более 500 мероприятий, объединивших около 253 000 человек» , - открыл мероприятие генеральный директор Центра предпринимательства Денис Дидковский. По словам корпоративного директора АСИ Елены Мякотниковой, предпринимательство является конкурентной средой, где важна качественная площадка для передачи и обмена практиками по построению коммерческих программ. «Мы живем в новой экономической реальности и здесь как никогда необходимы качественные программы обучения предпринимателей для формирования той самой конкурентной среды и развитие экономики страны в целом. Подобные программы, на мой взгляд, будут стимулировать людей к ведению своей предпринимательской деятельности. Мы готовы оказать поддержку развитию систематическим игрокам рынка для созданий качественных образовательных программ, направленных на представителей малого и среднего бизнеса» , - подчеркнула Елена Мякотникова. Президент Российской ассоциации бизнес-образования Сергей Мясоедов утверждает, что предпринимательство – тот двигатель, который поможет сделать жизнь людей лучше, и ему следует протянуть руку помощи. «Если говорить об экономике высоких технологий, о социально ориентированной экономике, то на сегодняшний день «скрытые чемпионы 21 века» — это средний бизнес, выросший из предпринимательских стартапов. Он формирует в Европе и Китае более половины ВВП. А в нашей стране менее 20%» - отмечает спикер. Важным аспектом развития предпринимательской среды в нашей стране является участие в обучении молодых предпринимателей и их психологической поддержке. Генеральный директор РАБО Наталья Евтихиева также акцентирует внимание на нехватку программ обучения предпринимателей в школах бизнеса. «Мы больше ориентированы на программы подготовки для крупного бизнеса. Это объясняется запросом от рынка, что оставляет МСП в стороне» - отмечает спикер. Сближение центра предпринимательства с РАБО, со школами бизнеса для переориентирования программы на молодежь и их предпринимательский дух уже положено в период короновирусной инфекции. «Не смотря на пандемию и на то, что мы изменили форматы, мы продолжим работу и продолжим добиваться результата. Нам всем это важно» - утверждает Наталья. На данный момент ключевой задачей является развитие предпринимательского образования в университетах и школах бизнеса для создания конкурентоспособного поколения Z.

В рамках реализации нацпроекта «Малое и среднее предпринимательство и поддержка индивидуальной предпринимательской инициативы» Центр предпринимательства совместно с ООО «БИСС» разработал уникальную тестовую методику выявления предрасположенностей к предпринимательским навыкам и компетенциям. Учащиеся из 7 учебных заведений в муниципальных образованиях Московской области прошли тестовый опрос, составленный с целью изучить их мотивационную сферу, личностные качества и предпринимательский потенциал. По результатам тестирования наиболее мотивированные респонденты и те, у кого была отмечена предрасположенность к предпринимательской деятельности, были приглашены на экспертную сессию. Учащиеся были разбиты на 8 команд по 10 человек в каждой для разработки краткого плана действий по реализации бизнес-идеи и презентации проекта перед экспертной комиссией. Каждой команде в помощь был выделен куратор. На суд экспертов, имеющих профессиональный опыт в сфере поддержки и развития предпринимательства, были представлены проекты по созданию кубика Рубика для незрячих и слабовидящих детей с использованием 3D-фломастера, а также изготовлению детского ночника на 3D-принтере. Кроме того, были предложены куртки для экстремально низких температур, инновационные лейки и концепции сайта для привлечение молодежи на мероприятия для предпринимателей. Экспертная комиссия проводила оценку перспективности и проработанности бизнес-идеи, а также подсказывала участникам, как можно усовершенствовать их подход. «Мы рады, что обучающиеся прошли тестирование по профориентации и получили ценные рекомендации по выбору дела своей жизни. Сейчас для них это особенно важно и актуально. Сформированные по результатам тестирования группы позволили участникам поработать в команде и выполнить проект с учетом пожеланий каждого. Эксперты с вниманием отнеслись к каждой представленной идее и очень воодушевили молодых людей на создание новых проектов», ― поделилась Комарова Валентина Юрьевна, заместитель директора МБОУ г.о.

В общей сложности пройдут десятки тысяч событий и тематических мероприятий, примут участие более 10 млн человек. «Свыше 55 регионов России присоединились к международной инициативе и проводят мероприятия, направленные на поддержку и популяризацию предпринимательской деятельности, ― прокомментировал Денис Дидковский, генеральный директор ООО «Центр предпринимательства». ― Мы уверены в том, что участие в GEW полезно всем участникам предпринимательской экосистемы. Ежегодно события в рамках него вдохновляют людей на открытие своего дела, связывая их с потенциальными сотрудниками, инвесторами и наставниками». Бесплатные события в рамках проекта проводятся не только для представителей малого и среднего предпринимательства, банков и корпораций, но также для начинающих предпринимателей, стартапов и тех, кто еще только задумывается о своем деле. GEW проходит под эгидой Всемирной предпринимательской сети (Global Entrepreneurship Network, GEN) – международной платформы программ и инициатив в более чем 170 странах, направленных на оказание поддержки любому предпринимательскому начинанию. GEN стимулирует установление связей между предпринимателями, инвесторами, исследователями, представителями государственных структур и организаций развития предпринимательства, выстраивая тем самым глобальную предпринимательскую экосистему. Напомним, что Россия одна из первых подхватила международную глобальную инициативу, и неоднократно получала приз за проведение самой активной Недели. В 2007 году по инициативе Центра предпринимательства проект стартовал в нашей стране и уже восемь лет подряд Неделя проходит при поддержке Министерства экономического развития Российской Федерации.

Мероприятие по выявлению предрасположенностей к профессиональным и предпринимательским навыкам и компетенциям также поддержали Министерство инвестиций и Министерство образования Московской области, а также Минэкономразвития России. «В рамках проекта по профориентации и тестированию Центр предпринимательства и ООО “БИСС” провели опрос более 10 000 начинающих и будущих предпринимателей, а также тех, кто планирует открыть свое дело и тех, кто никогда об этом не задумывался, из 65 муниципальных образований Московской области, ― отметил Дидковский Денис Владимирович, генеральный директор ООО «Центр предпринимательства». ― При содействии Администрации Серпухова была организована и проведена последняя экспертная сессия для более чем 130 человек, которые по результатам тестирования показали высокую предрасположенность к предпринимательской деятельности и мотивацию к освоению базовых предпринимательских навыков. Ранее состоялись экспертные сессии по представлению бизнес-идей в Королёве, Реутове и Жуковском. Реализация подобных мероприятий необходима, они способствуют популяризации предпринимательской деятельности, распространению в обществе информации об историях успеха и достижениях регионального бизнеса, а также осознанному профессиональному самоопределению жителей Московской области». В состав экспертной комиссии всех проведенных сессий вошли: Бакулин Александр Владимирович – директор центра оказания услуг «Мой бизнес» (г.Можайск); Владимирова Любовь Владимировна – председатель Комитета по образованию Администрации городского округа Серпухов Московской области. Гришин Михаил Владимирович – предприниматель, владелец рекламного агентства; Маханова Айсулу Набековна – бизнес-тренер, владелец сети детских садов «Ронни»; Михайлюк Алина Вадимовна – предприниматель, бизнес-консультант; Муханова Елена Александровна – директор Центра детства и юношества г.Серпухов. Член экспертной комиссии Михайлюк Алина Вадимовна рассказала, как проходила сессия в Серпухове для участников тестирования с высокой предрасположенностью к предпринимательской деятельности: «В начале мероприятия ребят разделили на группы, чтобы они коммуницировали и узнавали друг друга. После того, как они объединили свои идеи, мы перешли к разработке бизнес-проектов, которые они могли бы предложить для улучшения качества жизни в области. Молодые люди просчитали риски, финансовую часть проектов, потенциальную прибыль. У ребят, безусловно, есть предпринимательская жилка», - считает эксперт. «Ежегодно для старшеклассников проводятся подобные мероприятия и меня не перестает восхищать то, что в нашей стране есть такая возможность, чтобы наши дети воплощали все свои идеи, - поделилась впечатлениями от сессии и способностей ее участников сертифицированный бизнес-тренер Маханова Айсулу Набековна. - Дети совершенно удивительным образом черпают вдохновение друг у друга и не боятся предлагать самые смелые идеи. Взрослому человеку они могут показаться несколько безумными, но как раз за счет того, что у детей нет негативного опыта, они не видят преград ― только возможности. Я искренне ими восхищаюсь и радуюсь как предприниматель, что столько открывается возможностей в таком раннем возрасте». Маханова Айсулу Набековна по приглашению Центра предпринимательства также провела для участников проекта интенсив по бизнес-проектированию, в рамках которого обучила основным механизмам выбора и разработки бизнес-идеи для последующего грамотного составления бизнес-плана: «Сегодня молодые люди освоили самые базовые понятия предпринимательской деятельности, но это уже позволило им в командной работе разработать 10 полноценных бизнес-идей с финансовым и маркетинговым планом. Они проработали бизнес-проекты от идеи до запуска кампании. Полагаю, не каждому под силу с этим справиться в такой короткий срок, но сегодня участники это сделали». Завершилось мероприятие закреплением полученных знаний. Молодые люди учились применять их на практике, исполняя роли владельцев бизнеса. «Мы всегда рады поддержать такие инициативы, ― прокомментировал директор центра оказания услуг «Мой бизнес» г.Можайск Бакулин Александр Владимирович. ― В частности, Министерство инвестиций и инноваций делает основной упор на развитие молодежи среди предпринимателей. Сейчас существует масса мер поддержки, которые адаптированы именно на предпринимательскую инициативу молодёжи. Я хотел бы всем ребятам, и присутствующим, и тем, кто не успел прийти, пожелать успехов и удачи в их начинаниях Хотел бы пригласить их, в частности, в офис «Мой бизнес» для дальнейшего диалога, потому что идеи действительно очень интересные встречаются, особенно касаемо социального предпринимательства, что на сегодняшний день является одним из актуальных и приоритетных направлений правительства региона. Рад был бы с ними пообщаться. Совместно с Центром предпринимательства в рамках реализации национального проекта мы реализуем обучающие мероприятия для всех заинтересованных лиц и намерены продолжать сотрудничество в этом направлении». Экспертная комиссия также определила самых активных участников, которым вручили памятные призы. Победителями стали: Никитина Екатерина – 1 место (бизнес-проекты ― ритуальное агентство, свадебный салон); Удовиченко Екатерина – 2 место (молодежный центр «Шаг навстречу»); Свиридова Анастасия – 3 место (мини-завод по производству ювелирных изделий и подарков ручной работы из драгоценных камней – малахита и янтаря).

Традиционно организатором мероприятия выступила «Деловая Россия» совместно с Центром предпринимательства. С приветствием к участникам встречи обратился член генерального совета «Деловой России» Алексей Шатров. «В России сейчас наверняка одним из самых важных стопоров в экономике является пандемия. И мы все объединены общей целью, как сделать мир чуть лучше, как подтянуть здравоохранение. И та же самая проблематика актуальна для всего мира, и она очень острая» , — сказал он. Говоря о своём опыте запуска медицинских проектов, Алексей Шатров отметил, что здравая критика, полученная в нужный момент — это очень важный фактор успеха: «Подтянуть, помочь. Добрым словом, советом, последующим общением — это крайне нужно, и у участников сегодняшнего Startup клуба есть такая возможность получить эту необходимую помощь от экспертов» . В качестве экспертов выступили члены «Деловой России», представители профильного российского и зарубежного бизнеса, общественных объединений и науки, институтов развития, федеральных и региональных органов власти, институциональные и частные инвесторы. В их числе члены координационного совета «Деловой России» Александр Элинсон, Алексей Мартынов, Олег Мисевра и члены генерального совета Валерий Калюжный, Вячеслав Чупин, Дмитрий Куршин, Елена Кириленко, Сергей Лебедев и Владимир Кузнецов. Мобильный функциональный томограф Борис Юнг представил недорогой переносной томограф для применения в труднодоступных местах и массового обследования населения. Разработка защищена семью патентами на способ и устройство стимуляции и томографии. Команда проекта заинтересована в инвестициях. Oxima — медицинская маска из будущего Денис Медведев рассказал о новом средстве индивидуальной защиты, которое может с успехом заменить традиционные медицинские маски. Oxima призваны решить все проблемы, с которыми люди сталкиваются при использовании обычных масок: они хорошо защищают не только органы дыхания, но и глаза, не раздражают кожу, не требуют частой замены, не запотевают и не ограничивают видимость. Миокард-Смарт — ЭКГ-гаджет Антон Епифанов представил высокоточный, полезный и простой ЭКГ-прибор, который подобно измерителям артериального давления будет востребован в каждой семье. Он может применяться для индивидуального использования, для мониторинга больных в пределах территории больницы, для контроля спортсменов во время тренировок, а также для программы Минздрава России «Развитие технологий персонального мониторинга здоровья человека». Evimate — удалённый мониторинг показателей здоровья Михаил Файнштейн выступил с презентацией целой линейки устройств для мониторинга показателей здоровья. В неё входит термометр для непрерывного измерения температуры тела, беспроводной биосенсор для дистанционного мониторинга ЭКГ в течение 10 дней, ручка с возможностью снятия ЭКГ, а также ряд стильных аксессуаров. Прогнозирование персональной траектории развития заболеваний Пётр Чекунаев рассказал о разработке, которая помогает прогнозировать медицинские диагнозы на горизонте трёх лет с точностью 75%. Решение может быть полезно страховым компаниям, медицинским центрам и клиникам, а также экосистемам и в сфере электронной коммерции. Команда проекта ищет таких заказчиков. Разработка силовых электроинструментов для проведения травматолого-ортопедических операций Максим Крылов представил решение, призванное повысить процент успешной реабилитации после перелома шейки бедра следи пожилых людей. Предлагаемые инструменты отличаются минимальной зависимостью от импортных компонентов. Они уже апробированы на функциональность и силовые характеристики и полностью удовлетворяют потребности хирургов при проведении операций. Proteomarine — инновации в разработке лекарственных препаратов Александр Кудрявцев выступил с презентацией инновационного решения в фарминдустрии — препаратов на основе акульих нанотел. Они обладают уникальными свойствами: размер в десять раз меньше по сравнению с моноклональными антителами; производятся не в эукариотических клетках, а в бактериальных, что значительно удешевляет процесс производства. Кроме того, препараты на их основе отличаются высокой специфичностью к мишени и низкой иммуногенностью.

В традиционном формате Startup Huddle шесть предпринимателей рассказали о своих проектах, а члены генсовета «Деловой России» и приглашенные эксперты дали по ним рекомендации. Модератором встречи выступил партнёр CBI Pioneer, эксперт по инвестиционной привлекательности и региональным институтам развития Дмитрий Ягодкин. Открыл встречу руководитель Startup клуба, член генерального совета «Деловой России» Денис Дидковский. Он напомнил, что формат Startup Huddle в том числе направлен на поиск необходимых связей и решение инвестиционных задач. Кроме того, он анонсировал более глубокую работу с предпринимателями в Startup клубе «Деловой России»: «Мы рассматриваем возможность в расширенном формате вести работу со стартапами и закреплять наставников за проектами. Немедленная связь проектам — это отлично, это работает. Но многие просили, чтобы им давали постоянно помощь, чтобы формировались ментроские пары, проект сопровождался постоянно. В ближайшее время постараемся провести нетворкинг-сессию и такие пары сформировать» , — рассказал он. В заседании клуба участвовал также генеральный директор ООО «Агентство стратегического развития «ЦЕНТР» Сергей Георгиевский. Он кратко рассказал о конкурсной практике в области туризма и распределении средств на финансирование туристических кластеров. Свои проекты представили шесть предпринимателей. GeoBrox — маркетплейс туров по России Дмитрий Едакин представил маркетплейс активных туров по России. GeoBrox — это своего рода агрегатор туров, которые относятся к категориям «Активные выходные», «Адреналин и спорт», «Горный туризм», «Рыбалка и охота», «Кемпинг и походы», «Экспедиции». Создатели сервиса свели воедино все предложения туроператоров, чтобы клиент мог получить максимальный выбор в одном месте. По словам докладчика, на рынке есть компании с услугами такого рода, но это в основном агентства, которые перекупают турпродукт и с наценкой продают его конечному потребителю. GeoBrox же выступает площадкой, на которой встречаются оператор и турист. Компании Дмитрия Едакина необходимы инвестиции на продвижение и дальнейшую разработку и маркетинг, организацию работы техподдержки. Rekaonline.ru — водный транспорт, речная навигация, круизный туризм Кирилл Евдокимов рассказал о платформе Rekaonline. Это агрегатор речных прогулок и билетный сервис, который работает с 2018 года. Rekaonline может интегрироваться с билетными системами перевозчиков, с партнерскими сервисами по API. Кроме того, Кирилл Евдокимов указал, что себестоимость транзакций через Rekaonline получается ниже, чем конкурентов. Докладчик попросил экспертов поделиться опытом запуска успешных локальных проектов в аналогичных областях. OnlineExpress — умная система динамического проектирования туристических услуг Тарас Кобищанов выступил с докладом о проекте Online Express. Он предназначен для дистрибьюторов турпродукта и сочетает в себе преимущества самостоятельной сборки тура туристом и заказа через туроператора. В планах компании — локализация под зарубежные рынки и выход в Европу и Азию, привлечение к работе половины всех турагентств в России, а также дистрибьюторов из других сфер (банки, авиакомпании и другие). Южный Риф — морской рекреационный комплекс Николай Гришин выступил с идеей создания морского рекреационного комплекса с мариной и искусственной территорией, позволяющей разместить на ней просторные и комфортные общественные пространства в виде набережных, пляжей и парковой зоны, а также отели и торгово-развлекательный центр. По его словам, предлагаемое решение — единственный вариант создания в Сочи новых комфортных и инвестиционно привлекательных набережных. Одновременно это позволит расширить возможности Адлерского транспортно-пересадочного узла с участием водного транспорта. Николай Гришин заинтересован в проектном финансировании. Возрождение усадьбы Федяшево (НП «Русская усадьба») Вера Стерлина представила социально направленный проект «Возрождение усадьбы Федяшево». Его цель — восстановить архитектурно-парковый ансамбль усадьбы как многопрофильного рентабельного комплекса и вовлечь его в культурно-туристический и хозяйственный оборот страны. Федяшево — усадьба с богатейшей, 500-летней историей. Например, жена одного из ее владельцев стала прообразом Анны Карениной из одноименного романа. Усадьба расположена в Тульской области, до нее легко добраться по железной или автодороге. В проекте предусмотрено не только восстановление парковых зон, но и создание гостиниц, кафе, досуговых возможностей — именно для этого проект планирует привлечь финансирование со стороны бизнеса. Туристический кластер Кенозерского национального парка Наталья Плеханова рассказала о формировании нового туристического кластера и — соответственно — туристических маршрутов в Архангельской области. Разрабатываемые маршруты будут вести путешественников через Русский Север, соединяя значимые объекты культурного наследия, святые места, заповедники и национальные парки. Ключевой элемент кластера — развитие рекреационной зоны Кенозерского парка. Дорожная карта проекта пока сформирована до 2025 года. Проект ищет партнеров и участников с готовыми решениями. График ближайших мероприятий Startup клуба: 15 октября — финансовые технологии 29 октября — экспорт 11-12 октября — медицина (в рамках форума АСИ «Сильные идеи для нового времени») 19 октября — Startup клуб в рамках Всемирной недели предпринимательства, экспорт 3 ноября — цифровая промышленность Если вы хотите стать участником , выступить со своим проектом или предложить другую отраслевую тематику, обратитесь к Анастасии Кузиной: akuzina@cfe.ru , +7 (926) 032-84-07 или Андрею Маевскому: maevsky@deloros.ru , +7 (495) 649-18-26, доб. 368.

Модератором встречи выступила заместитель директора АНО Институт исследований и экспертизы ВЭБ.РФ Юлия Зворыкина. Технотроникс — система мониторинга аккумуляторных батарей Член Пермского регионального отделения «Деловой России» Евгения Тихонова представила компанию «Технотроникс» — разработчика и производителя систем мониторинга и учета ресурсов на промышленных и инфраструктурных объектах. Проект по мониторингу и предиктивной аналитике аккумуляторных батарей — это внутренний стартап компании, который предполагает новый подход к прогнозированию остаточной емкости и уровня заряда АКБ в системах гарантированного питания с применением технологий искусственного интеллекта для создания цифровой модели процесса функционирования аккумулятора. Компания ищет выходы на крупных клиентов и сегменты рынка, где может быть полезно подобное решение. Газовое пожаротушение в электроустановках Член Московского регионального отделения «Деловой России» Антон Вдовиченко выступил с презентацией инновационных решений для пожарной безопасности — модулей газового пожаротушения «Заря» и автономных устройств пожаротушения «УльтраZ». Он подчеркнул, что это первое и единственное в России производство полного цикла.Для масштабирования проекта требуется плотное взаимодействие с проектными институтами и организациями, застройщиками и генподрядными организациями. Цифровизация бизнес-процессов управления активами предприятия с использование информационно-аналитической системы на базе NPT Platform Член генерального совета «Деловой России» Александр Сегаль и заместитель генерального директора по НИОКР компании «ЭнергопромАвтоматизация»Игорь Кумецрассказали о проекте по цифровизации бизнес-процессов. Основное назначение корпоративной информационной системы — это представление руководителю полной и точной картины предприятия, которая позволит оценить эффективность функционирования основных систем, выявить «лишние» издержки и факторы, мешающие увеличению прибыльности. NPT Platform позволяет создавать информационные системы для автоматизации производственной деятельности энергетических предприятий, обеспечивая автоматический сбор данных со всех источников и устройств, интеграцию и обработку собранных данных и представление их пользователю в удобном формате. Система накопления и распределения энергии (СНЭЭ) Денис Метальников представил четыре линейки систем накопления энергии, а также сопутствуюище продукты и услуги. Представленные им продукты отличаются высокой функциональностью, возможностью удаленного мониторинга и управления, диагностики и т.д., а также в перспективе возможностью управления группой СНЭЭ как распределенной резервной энергоемкостью. Компания ищет возможности для запуска коммерческих «пилотов» на рынках инфраструктуры, а также нацелена на получение коммерческого «пилота» и финансирования производства пилотной установки для рынка электроснабжения добывающих объектов (буровых, карьеров). Создание цифровых комплексов для управления энергообъектами Владимир Куделькин рассказал об интеграционной платформе «Интегра 4D-Планета Земля» для объектов энергетического комплекса. Это геоинформационная система в формате 4D, где все наблюдаемые объекты, оборудование (датчики, сенсоры, контроллеры, камеры, транспортные средства и даже видеопотоки) имеют привязку к географическим координатам и времени. Изобретение запатентовано, аналогов системы в мире нет. SpinCell — энергоэффективные, энергосберегающие теплообменники на основе закрутки потока Александр Лебедев выступил с презентацией инновационного решения для интенсификации теплообмена. По сравнению с существующими теплообменниками SpinCell увеличивает теплоотдачу в 1,5–2 раза, обладает эффектом «самоочистки», меньше по массе и габаритам. Решение может применяться в теплоснабжении зданий, «большой» энергетике, нефтегазовой и нефтехимической отраслях, для охлаждения в техпроцессах металлургии и машиностроения, в пищевой промышленности и медицине, а также в транспортной отрасли. EMS INSYTE — открытая IoT платформа для управления энергоресурсами Выступление Сергея Грибанова было посвящено облачному роботу для энергосбережения, который автоматически управляет подключенными к сети зданиями, производствами, магазинами, оборудованием, поддерживая наиболее энергоэффективные сценарии работы с помощью технологий машинного обучения и интернета вещей. Команда проекта планирует занять 3–5% мирового рынка цифровых сервисов в энергетике к 2025 году. График ближайших мероприятий в 2021 году: 19 августа — экспорт; 9 сентября — IT-проекты (софт).

Эксперты встретились с инициаторами проектов, направленных на развитие новых туристических маршрутов и инфраструктуры. Модератором дискуссии стал член экспертного совета национального рейтинга инвестиционной привлекательности РФ Дмитрий Ягодкин. Открыл встречу член генсовета «Деловой России» и глава клуба Денис Дидковский: «Формат нашего клуба лаконичен и направлен, в первую очередь, на получение необходимой обратной связи, рекомендаций от экспертов. Мы просим выступающих коротко рассказать о проекте, поделиться бизнес-моделью, сформулировать запрос на экспертную и, возможно, на инвестиционную поддержку». Специальным гостем мероприятия стала представитель Ростуризма. Начальник управления государственных туристских проектов и безопасности туризма Елена Лысенкова отметила, что открытие новых направлений стимулирует развитие туристического потока внутри страны и развивает в отрасли сектор государственно-частного партнёрства. «Государственно частное партнёрство для туризма начинает приобретать абсолютно другие ракурсы и возможности, нежели это было раньше», — полагает она. Сегодня на площадке федерального агентства получают развитие инициативы в индустрии туризма и гостеприимства. Елена Лысенкова рассказала о проектах Ростуризма для льготного субсидирования предпринимателей отрасли по ставке от 3 до 5 %. Агентство заинтересовано в новых точках роста для туристического кластера. Одной из мер поддержки предпринимателей станет конкурс на получение грантовой субсидии для развития малых объектов туристической инфраструктуры. Конкурс на получение поддержки пройдёт уже в августе. Авторы стартап-проектов в рамках питч-сессии смогли пообщаться с потенциальными инвесторами и получить рекомендации по развитию проектов от экспертов отрасли. Мобильный аудиогид Директор по развитию сервиса городских аудиотуров Izi.travel Егор Яковлев рассказал об инвестиционной привлекательности аудиогидов для путешествий. В приложении, представленном в рамках проекта, есть всё для интересного и комфортного путешествия – аудиогид, карты, рекомендации по маршруту. Разработчики приложения с применением GPS научили смартфон включать нужные истории в нужных местах. Платформа предлагает экскурсии по разным городам, музеям и выставкам. Классический аудиогид, который человек покупает в музее проведёт его только по экспозиции. Приложение Izi.travel сопроводит его интересной экскурсией от дома до музея. Интересные истории будут сопровождать путешественника, пока он едет до пункта назначения на машине или электричке. Сегодня у платформы тысячи партнёров и амбассадоров, которые за счёт своей рекламы позволяют делать приложение бесплатным для всех пользователей. Приложение Izi.travel уже сейчас можно скачать на ведущих цифровых площадках. Горнолыжный курорт Бизнес-модель туристско-рекреационного кластера «Гора Белая» в Свердловской области представила предприниматель Марина Ленькова. Спикер отметила, что сегодня на Урале, богатом на живописную природу и интересные места, масло инфраструктуры для отдыха. Марина Ленькова рассказала о проекте развития горнолыжного курорта «Гора Белая» делоросса Леонида Гункевича, который позволит туристам отдохнуть с европейским комфортом, не выезжая за пределы страны. Сейчас комплекс «Гора Белая» располагает только четырьмя трассами, подъёмниками и одной маленькой гостиницей. Инвестиции помогут сделать курорт доступным, удобным и привлекательным для туристов. Маркетплейс морских круизов Создатель проекта crugo.online Денис Крейцберг рассказал о приложении «Твой круиз». Сегодня на рынке особой популярностью пользуются морские и речные круизы, но приобретение путёвки занимает много времени и требует присутствия клиента в офисе. Эксперты crugo.online упростили процесс покупки билета на круизный лайнер. Теперь оформить путешествие можно через приложение в сматфоне. Путешественник может определить маршрут, выбрать каюту и получить электронные билеты. На данный момент проект полностью «упакован» и готов к реализации. Кешбэк путешествиями Предприниматель Евгений Алёхин убеждал участников клуба, что путешествия могут быть бесплатными. Автор проекта #TRAVELFREE рассказал о возможностях онлайн-сервиса, где бонусы от покупок возвращаются не деньгами, а путешествиями. Участники программы лояльности могут, расплачиваясь в магазинах-партнёрах и получать баллы, которые в дальнейшем конвертируются в мили для бесплатных перелётов по всему миру. Эксперты платформы уже интегрировали в проект более 500 известных российских компаний. Деревенский туризм Гендиректор компании «Спутник Югра» Василий Сочилин по-новому посмотрел на развитие внутреннего туризма. Он предложил проект Russian timeshare village, в рамках которого возможно развитие российских посёлков, расположенных рядом с объектами природного достояния. Например, деревня Усть-Манья, находящаяся рядом с плато Маньпупунёр в Республике Коми может получить достойную инфраструктуру за счёт инвестиций, а туристы смогут с большим комфортом посещать природную достопримечательность. Проект направлен не только на развитие внутреннего туризма, но и сохранение экологического благополучия природных зон. В заключение мероприятия выступила исполнительный директор Инвестклуба «Деловой России» Ольга Алёшина. Она высоко оценила проекты участников StartupHuddle и пригласила к дальнейшему сотрудничеству в рамках работы комитета по туризму делового объединения. Модератор мероприятия Дмитрий Ягодкин считает, что проекты должны получать не только инвестиционную, но и экспертную поддержку для успешного развития. Организаторы планируют провести повторную сессию Startup-клуба, посвящённую туризму, чтобы ознакомиться с другими проектами. Ближайшие мероприятия StartUp Клуба: 20 августа – экспорт; 3 сентября – IT- индустрия; 17 сентября – малая энергетика; 1 октября – медицина.

Встреча прошла при поддержке Центра предпринимательства в формате Startup Huddle. Открывая мероприятие, председатель Startup клуба, генеральный директор Центра предпринимательства Денис Дидковский напомнил, что это уже третья встреча клуба по проектам в сфере финтех, а также отметил: «Сегодня у нас представлено 7 компаний, среди них и начинающие, амбициозные игроки рынка финансовых технологий, которые пытаются придумать и реализовать новые бизнес-модели, и достаточно взрослые компании. У спикеров традиционно есть до 6 минут на питч, за которым следует около 20 минут дискуссии с экспертами. Ожидаемый итог – обмен отраслевыми контактами, помощь советами и продолжение обсуждения или сотрудничества вне рамок Startup клуба» . Во встрече приняли участие члены генерального совета «Деловой России» Виталий Арбузов, Анна Надобных, Денис Сережкин, Ирина Писаревская, Артём Афанасьев и Алексей Мостовщиков. Также присутствовали представители членов ген совета Александра Сегаля, Дмитрия Гусева, Григория Березкина, Андрея Романенко и Алексея Кучмина. Модератором выступил Семён Фомин, предприниматель, основатель и управляющий партнёр СОВЕТ#1. Участники представили следующие проекты. Stockeasy – сервис по поиску акций Ирина Ахмадуллина рассказала о тренде низких ставок по депозитам, заставляющем население искать альтернативные источники получения дохода. По ее словам, на сегодняшний день только порядка 2 млн россиян каждый месяц совершают операции на брокерских счетах, а частные инвесторы в России испытывают потребность в инструментах для анализа и подбора инструментов в свои инвестиционные портфели. В связи с этими тенденциями была разработана экосистема для частных инвесторов FINIQ – онлайн-платформа с библиотекой курсов, вебинаров, аналитикой, направленная на развитие инвестиционного мышления у людей. В экосистему FINIQ входят обучающая платформа, мобильное приложение, аудиоподкаст, блог и YouTube канал, которые помогают оптимизировать поиск инвестиционных идей для частных инвесторов, предоставляя полную информацию о возможных рисках и доходностях. Сервис также позволяет выбирать акции с учетом целей инвестора и оценивать совокупный инвестиционный доход с учетом возможных рисков. Финансирование для МСП на рынке облигаций Павел Соловьёв представил инвестиционную экосистему «InBonds», интегрированную с центральной инфраструктурой (МБ, НКЦ, НРД). Целью проекта стало создание удобного и востребованного инвестиционного портала, обеспечивающего доступность услуг на финансовом рынке для частных инвесторов и эмитентов, способствующего распространению финансовой грамотности населения и бизнеса. По словам основателя, InBonds – это сервис для конечных участников рынка, который не предполагает создания альтернативных торговых систем, а скорее рассчитан на интеграцию с центральной инфраструктурой в таких форматах, как: сделки на вторичном рынке с обращающимися на МБ облигациями, сделки по размещению биржевых облигаций, сделки с коммерческими облигациями на вторичном рынке и сделки по размещению коммерческих облигаций. TenChat – финансовый маркетплейс и социальная сеть для бизнеса Семён Теняев рассказал о проекте компании «ВБЦ», «TenChat», социальной сети для работы и бизнеса, основанной на десятках сервисов для заработка. Платформа предлагает широкие возможности для пользователей благодаря использованию уникального AI-подхода – все сервисы построены на основе искусственного интеллекта, что позволяет вывести взаимодействие с пользователем на новый уровень, например режим поиска тендеров ГосТиндер, объединивший ИИ, ИНН и режим свайпов. По словам Семёна, за полгода развития на этапе β-тестирования, по WOM-модели (сарафанному радио), характерной для социальных сетей, было собрано 42 000 активных пользователей. Революционное решение, которое предлагает команда проекта – это механизм взаимодействия бизнеса, государства и общества в рамках единой digital-экосистемы. Virtu Systems – финансово-страховая ИТ платформа Олег Ряшенцев представил проект «Virtu Systems», цифровую платформу для продажи финансово-страховых продуктов. Основная цель платформы – помочь клиентам быстро выводить продукты на рынок и продавать их через разных партнеров (банки, дилеры, турфирмы, агенты и т.п.). Основные ноу-хау, использующиеся командой проекта: инновационная фабрика, позволяющая продавцам быстро настраивать продукты без программирования и экспериментировать с каналами; облачная платформа, упрощающая процесс взаимодействия клиентов с посредниками; а также агрегаторы для партнеров, объединяющие все комиссионные продукты и сервисы в одном окне или в одном универсальном API. Fly penny – крипто-мобильный сервис привлечения социально активных покупателей Василий Громов рассказал о первой криптовалюте со смыслом «Fly penny». По словам Василия, большинство покупателей испытывают такие сложности при использовании карт программ лояльности в сетевых магазинах, как: индивидуальные карты лояльности в каждом сетевом магазине, необходимость в чрезмерном количестве действий для использования накопленных баллов на кассе, малозначительные скидки. В результате перечисленные проблемы приводят к низкой мотивации клиентов и посетителей. Команда проекта создала сервис, который помогает решить проблемы в 4 шага: раздача крипто-благодарностей за визит в магазин, сбор крипто-благодарностей от камер контроля скорости на дорогах 88 стран мира, прием крипто-благодарностей на кассе, которые работают как бонусы для оплаты покупок, а также регулярные крипто-благодарности фондам, которые можно включить по желанию. LOEE – кэшбэк за товар от производителей в мобильных приложениях банков Дмитрий Горьков представил компанию CASHOFF, которая работает на рынке открытого и приоткрытого API для создания b2b продуктов для банков и производителей товаров, а также b2c продукты, которые улучшают клиентский опыт взаимодействия. Сейчас компания активно развивается на рынках России, СНГ, Европы и Азии и предлагает потребителю 4 продукта: импорт данных из банков, инвестиционных компаний и т.д.; загрузка и анализ данных, а также подбор оптимального продукта; кэшбек за товары; b2c продукт – мобильное приложение «Yepy», которое объединяет все эти технологии. Основное внимание Дмитрий уделил b2b программе «LOEE», в рамках которой банки получают доход за счет комиссии от партнеров и ценности для клиента в виде кэшбэка, который спонсируют не торговые сети и банки самостоятельно, а именно производитель товара. Умный маркет – персональный помощник для самозанятых Михаил Валуйский рассказал о проекте «Умный маркет», мобильном приложении для самозанятых, которое предназначено для поиска клиентов и продажи товаров собственного производства на маркетплейсах. &quot;Умный маркет&quot; имеет удобный и понятный функционал с прозрачным платежным сервисом, быстрым подключением к платежам, статистикой продаж и выкладкой товаров в один клик. По словам Михаила, главная цель проекта – помочь самозанятым (вендорам), в том числе из сельской местности и покупателям найти друг друга и облегчить процесс купли-продажи через интернет. Проект примечателен тем, что стал финалистом онлайн-хакатона по запуску стартапов в сфере самозанятости SMZ Hack 2.0 «Мы активно помогаем ФНС с реализацией важного закона по самозанятости , - в заключение отметил член генерального совета «Деловой России», главный организатор финтех-хакатона SMZ Hack 2.0 Денис Серёжкин. - И одними из первых вышли на рынок с уже готовыми финтех-решениями. Второй год проводим хакатон-инкубатор по разработке сервисов для самозанятых. Это площадка для развития и реализации молодых команд, куда приходит много интересных разработчиков. Они активно участвуют во всех проектах, связанных с самозанятостью и считают это прогрессивным трендом. Ребята с «Умным маркетом» как раз стали финалистами хакатона SMZ Hach 2.0,который только что завершился. Нам больше всего понравились, что они реализовали решение буквально за 3 дня, быстро и четко, и используют весь функционал, который у них есть, чтобы предложить самозанятым новый и полезный сервис».

Авторы проектов в рамках питч-сессии смогли пообщаться с потенциальными инвесторами и партнерами, получить рекомендации по развитию проектов от экспертов отрасли. Платформа управления производственными активами Представитель компании CyberPhysics Сергей Николаев рассказал экспертам о проекте платформы управления производственными активами на основе физического моделирования и машинного обучения. Благодаря автоматизированному анализу состояния оборудования, эксперты CyberPhysics могут прогнозировать поломку станка или износ производственной системы. На основании данных, предоставляемых платформой, сотрудники предприятия могут заблаговременно планировать ремонтные работы или закупку оборудования. Сервис объединяет всю информацию о технических параметрах производственного процесса и даёт подробную картину состояния оборудования. Сегодня компания CyberPhysics уже успешно оптимизирует производственные процессы для российских производителей. В перспективе эксперты платформы планируют выходить на международный рынок. Искусственный интеллект для управления производством Генеральный директор компании IOSYA Илья Развин представил экспертам интеллектуальную систему поддержки управления производством. Интеллектуальная оптимизация работы производственного оборудования химических предприятий на основе комбинации технических и финансовых параметров позволяет наиболее точно рассчитать финансовую и ресурсную составляющую производства. Эксперты компании помогают предприятиям сделать производство менее энергозатратным и более быстрым с помощью анализа данных. Искусственный интеллект выбирает наиболее трудоёмкие звенья производства и предлагает оптимизацию для их работы. Новый метод производства привычных вещей Гендиректор и совладелец компании «ТРИАНГУЛЯТИКА» Денис Власов представил проект экосистемы компаний ООО «Эксклюзивные Решения» и ООО «ТРИАНГУЛЯТИКА» для выпуска продуктов с новыми потребительскими свойствами и конкурентной экономикой производства. Компании в партнёрстве разрабатывают продукты на базе аддитивных технологий. Эксперты экосистемы предлагают альтернативный дешёвый метод производства деталей и комплектующих. С помощью 3D-принтеров разрабатываются модели любой формы и размера. Технология может применяться для создания инструментов, деталей, комплектующих, применяемых в различных отраслях: от косметологии до химической промышленности. Преимуществом компании на рынке является дешёвая себестоимость готового изделия, заметно отличающаяся от аналогов. Специалистами компании ранее была разработанная компактная система 3D-печати металлами Russian SLM FACROTY, которая пользуется популярностью у российских производителей. Запрос экосистемы компаний ООО «Эксклюзивные Решения» и ООО «ТРИАНГУЛЯТИКА» заключается в новых идеях для производства оригинальных вещей, не имеющих аналогов в мире. Виртуальная фабрика Основатель компании «Виртуальные производственные системы» Олег Пономарев рассказал об агрегаторе сетевых распределенных производственных мощностей. Специалисты компании создали платформу, благодаря которой производитель может в режиме реального времени отслеживать показатели производительности оборудования. Более того, система подскажет, как правильно распределить ресурсы производства, чтобы станки работали на полную мощность. Разработка особенно актуальна для крупных производственных компаний, так как без системного анализа они не могут в полной мере отслеживать нагрузку на оборудование. Система помогает оптимизировать процесс производства – от заказа детали и составления макета до оптимизации сроков выполнения работы и сбалансированности нагрузки на станок. Авторы проекта ищут инвестиционной поддержки и экспертного сотрудничества для выхода на новые рынки. Интеллектуальная производственная платформа Руководитель проекта интеллектуальной производственной платформы I5.solutions Вадим Скворцов предложил новый подход к выбору изготовителя производственных деталей и комплектующих. Интеллектуальная платформа, разработанная специалистами I5.solutions, работает по принципу системы Booking или Aviasales. Искусственный интеллект поможет заказчику выбрать наиболее дешёвого производителя для своей детали. Зачастую заказчик не имеет возможности быстро выбрать выгодные условия сотрудничества с производителем. Проблема заключается, как правило, в расчёте себестоимости комплектующей и экономической выгоды от сотрудничества. Система экспертной оценки стоимости изготовления детали поможет на основе 3D-модели подобрать наиболее выгодные условия и надежных исполнителей. Заказчику останется только выбрать наиболее выгодное предложение. Сегодня разработчики платформы планируют подключить к системе 50 новых производств. Авторы проекта планируют масштабировать платформу и выходить на новые рынки. Информационная система для управления производством Представитель компании SmartBase Сергей Суханцев представил low-code платформу управления производственными данными. Часто производители не могут точно определить, какая часть производственного цикла влияет на качество продукции. Автоматизированная информационная платформа, которую предлагают разработчики SmartBase, систематизирует данные о производственном процессе. На их основе система автоматически анализирует все этапы производства продукции и даёт подробный отчёт. Таким образом производитель может не только отслеживать динамику качества продукта, но и совершенствовать технологию там, где это наиболее необходимо.

Встреча традиционно прошла в формате Startup Huddle — семь предпринимателей представили свои проекты, а эксперты дали по ним обратную связь и предложили возможности для развития. Открывая встречу, руководитель Startup клуба, член генерального совета «Деловой России» Денис Дидковский напомнил, что формат мероприятия ориентирован, в первую очередь, на экспертную помощь: «Встреча направлена на то, чтобы коллеги из отрасли, которым проект интересен, сразу дали обратную связь, договорились о возможных пилотах и взаимодействии, которые могли бы быть интересны стартапу» . Также глава клуба пригласил экспертов и спикеров к участию во Всемирной неделе предпринимательства, которая состоится с 16 по 22 ноября. 17 ноября, в частности, на площадке Деловой России пройдет встреча Startup клуба с привлечением международных экспертов и иностранных инвесторов для компаний, ориентированных на экспорт в страны Европы и Азии. Руководитель направления «Робототехника и искусственный интеллект» фонда «Сколково» Павел Кривозубов отметил, что такой формат очень ценен для стартапов в области робототехники. «Прямой выход на инвесторов — это то, что нужно. Для нас как института развития очень ценно, что мы делаем такие мероприятия совместно с “Деловой Россией”, потому что это помогает найти заказчиков, найти инвесторов, пообщаться, обсудить проекты, получить ценный фидбек от отрасли, от заказчиков — для стартапов это самое ценное, это помогает им расти, увеличивать выручку, находить новые заказы» . Модератором встречи выступил партнёр CBI Pioneer, эксперт по инвестиционной привлекательности и региональным институтам развития Дмитрий Ягодкин. Участники встречи представили семь проектов. Компания Golf Robotics Вячеслав Голицын представил робота для сбора мячей для гольфа. По словам спикера, каждый гольф-клуб тратит тысячи долларов на сбор мячей: зарплаты дополнительных сотрудников, затраты на покупку и обслуживание тяжелой техники, которая к тому же портит поле и мячи. Робот полностью автономный, работает по GPS, объезжает препятствия, автоматически выгружает собранные мячи и заряжается. Компания ищет стратегического инвестора, помощь в сертификации и выходе на рынок Европы. Интеллектуальный модуль для установки на летательные аппараты «Вершина» Алексей Гришаев выступил с презентацией интеллектуального модуля полезной нагрузки для автоматического обнаружения объектов, который устанавливается на летательные аппараты. Модуль предназначен для поиска потерявшихся людей, животных, техники, огня. Устройство состоит из оптической камеры, тепловизора, микрокомпьютера и специально разработанного активного подвеса, способного гасить любые вибрации. Компания ищет дополнительное финансирование проекта, чтобы довести модуль до стадии предсерийного образца для проведения испытаний совместно с заказчиками и выйти на первые продажи. Роботизированная поисково-спасательная система от «РобБотКрафт» Роман Беляев рассказал о проекте, цель которого — создание комплексной роботизированной поисково-спасательной системы, позволяющей безопасно эксплуатировать и обслуживать все типы судов, включая безэкипажные и роботизированные средства освоения морских ресурсов. Имеющиеся на рынке средства спасения решают отдельные задачи — например, термозащита или поддержание на плаву. Авторы проекта утверждают, что их система решает весь комплекс задач по спасению человека от определения падения в воду до извлечения на плавсредство, термозащиты и передачи данных о его геопозиции. Компания ищет потенциальных заказчиков системы и ее компонентов, а также инвестиции. Программные роботы Sherpa RPA Константин Артемьев представил платформу, которая позволяет проектировать роботов для решения рутинных задач. Программные роботы, созданные с помощью этой платформы, могут заполнять формы, составлять отчеты, обеспечивать обмен данными между несовместимыми системами, сверять документы, обрабатывать запросы, искать и сравнивать информацию в интернете. Например, робот может помогать отделу закупок находить более выгодные предложения — по данным авторов проекта, бюджет на закупки сокращается на 3–5%, окупается такой робот за 2–3 месяца, а внедряется за три недели. Такие роботы могут применяться при обслуживании клиентов, в работе бухгалтерии и отдела кадров, а также в продажах, менеджменте, логистике, делопроизводстве, IT-администрировании. Компания ищет выходы на руководителей отделов цифровой трансформации, закупок и финансовых отделов крупных промышленных компаний России. Беспилотная авиационная система для обработки сельскохозяйственных культур Grom Кирилл Левчук выступил с презентацией робота, который может использоваться для обработки сельхозкультур вместо самолета, трактора или ручного труда. Робот позволяет экономить химические вещества за счет точечной обработки, максимально автоматизировать процесс и свести к минимуму человеческий фактор. Кроме того, использование Grom снижает экологические риски. Авторы проекта ищут экспертов в сфере сельского хозяйства, чтобы усовершенствовать методику введения гербицидов и пестицидов, партнеров среди сельхозпроизводителей и дистрибьюторов сельскохозяйственной химии. Кроме того, компания заинтересована в инвестициях и консультации экспертного сообщества по вопросам масштабирования проекта. Coffeebot: юниты и SaaS-решения Виктор Гончарук рассказал о компании Coffebot, которая разрабатывает роботизированные coffee/food юниты и SaaS для удаленного управления ими. Применение таких решений особенно актуально во время пандемии, роста популярности доставки и тренда на бесконтактность. Авторы проекта ссылаются на исследование, которое прогнозирует замену 94% бариста роботами и рост использования роботов вообще в фудтехе на 29% к 2029 году. Компания ищет партнера из числа крупных фастфуд-сетей для запуска совместного пилотного проекта, а также инвестиции и технологических партнеров. Робот-каменщик Максим Евдокимов представил робота-каменщика. Его компания разрабатывает технологии роботизированного строительства, новые материалы для робота-каменщика, в том числе вяжущие без цемента. Через три года она планирует запустить продажи комплектов для сооружения купольных домов из специального плитного материала. По словам Максима Евдокимова, робот-каменщик замещает не только каменщиков, но и электриков, и отделочников. Компания ищет партнеров среди опытных разработчиков в области строительной геохимии, а также контакты со строительными компаниями в Африке и на Ближнем Востоке.

Ее участники представили и прокомментировали проекты развития экономики и инфраструктуры Арктической зоны России в области энергетики и транспорта, арктического туризма и сельского хозяйства. Соорганизаторами встречи вместе с «Деловой Россией» выступили Центр предпринимательства и Агентство «ПОРА». Модерировал мероприятие предприниматель, основатель и управляющий партнер СОВЕТ#1 Семен Фомин. Открывая встречу, глава Startup клуба Денис Дидковский отметил: «Я рад, что клуб за короткий срок прошел большой путь от небольших частных историй в начале до крупных и сегодня среди них мы рассмотрим проекты, связанные с развитием территорий, авиастроением, судостроением, туризмом и образованием в сложных Арктических условиях» . С приветствием к участникам обратилась заместитель директора Института ВЭБ, член общественного совета министерства по развитию Дальнего Востока и Арктики Юлия Зворыкина. Она отметила, что для России сейчас очень важно собрать проекты, которые будут представлены на Арктическом Совете и выразила надежду на продуктивное сотрудничество в этом вопросе со Startup клубом. Эксперты клуба рассмотрели и прокомментировали шесть проектов. Арктический самолет Ан-2ММ и многоцелевые дирижабли Андрей Иванов обратил внимание на фактическую и моральную деградацию парка малой авиации, которая препятствует развитию экономики Севера. Его проект предполагает разработку нового типа самолета малой авиации и возобновление дирижаблестроения. Первый продукт в рамках проекта — это арктический самолет Ан-2ММ, модернизированная версия «кукурузника». Опытный образец уже прошел летные испытания. Второй продукт — многоцелевые дирижабли для транспортировки негабаритных грузов, обустройства месторождений, перевозки пассажиров, заправки судов. Авторы проекта попросили экспертов оценить бизнес-модель и прокомментировать модель финансирования для реконструкции малых аэродромов и площадок в Арктике. Комплекс для механико-лазерного метода ликвидации разливов нефти и нефтепродуктов на Арктическом шельфе Дмитрий Чухланцев представил проект, который предполагает создание в Архангельской области экологического оператора, который безопасно ликвидирует нефтяные разливы в Арктической шельфовой зоне. Стратегия развития включает разработку лазерного комплекса для ликвидации нефтяных разливов, закупку судов на воздушной подушке для размещения на их базе лазерного комплекса, строительство инфраструктуры экологического оператора — теплых доков и зданий. Лазерное излучение рассматривается как метод очистки в дополнение к традиционному механическому. Тематический образовательный парк «Великие северные экспедиции — русская Арктика» Наталья Волынец выступила с презентацией круглогодичного образовательного парка, рассчитанного, в первую очередь, на жителей Санкт-Петербурга и Ленинградской области, в перспективе — на школьников со всей России. Проект реализуется на существующей инфраструктуре, по сути это новая часть уже действующего парка, который получил первую премию в конкурсе «Лучшие в туризме Ленинградской области — 2019». Авторы проекта заинтересованы в экспертной поддержке, софинансировании и помощи в продвижении. «Ступени в Арктику» — инновационные решения для ледокольного флота Юрий Чашков представил ледокол с инновационным механизмом разрушения льда, благодаря которому льдины не попадают на винты и в канал и не мешают движению следующих в караване судов. Подобный механизм разрушения льда на судах ледового плавания в мире пока не применяется. Он требует на 40% меньше мощности энергетической установки, не требует разработки новых или приобретения иностранных технологий — за счет этого стоимость его реализации ниже, чем аналогичных проектов. Использование композитного мобильного здания в суровых климатических условиях Арктики Эдуард Брыков рассказал о возможностях использования композитного мобильного здания при температуре воздуха от —60 до +60 градусов. Эффект термоса позволяет находиться в жилой капсуле до 24 часов после аварийного отключения отопления. Высокая энергоэффективность здания позволяет использовать его в Арктической зоне и на Крайнем Севере. Само здание представляет собой модульную конструкцию, которая легко собирается и разбирается в любых климатических условиях. Авторы проекта попросили экспертов прокомментировать требования к модульным зданиям при организации вахтовых поселков в сложных климатических условиях Арктики и государственные программы развития Арктики и Крайнего Севера, в которых проект мог бы поучаствовать. Создание вездеходной техники с использованием современных технологий Матвей Матюшин представил проект, ориентированный на бизнес, активность которого связана с труднодоступными регионами России. Вездеходы могут использоваться для спасательных работ, добычи полезных ископаемых, обслуживания линейных объектов, геологоразведки, сельского хозяйства, научной и экологической деятельности, логистики в труднодоступной местности, а также для активного отдыха и туризма — охоты и рыбалки.

В заседании в качестве экспертов приняли участие члены Генерального Совета Деловой России: Наталья Кириллова, Алексей Шатров, Илья Микин, Виталий Арбузов, Борис Пастухов, Игорь Силин, Валерий Калюжный, Вячеслав Решетник, Денис Садовский, Александр Сегаль, Максим Савинков, Алексей Кучмин, Алексей Мостовщиков, Денис Дидковский, Александр Масленников, а также член Координационного Совета Деловой России Александр Элинсон. Открывая встречу, председатель Startup клуба и гендиректор Центра предпринимательства Денис Дидковский выразил благодарность присутствующим экспертам сообщества и отметил: «Рад, что мы проводим очередное, 3-е по счету, заседание Клуба по искусственному интеллекту. Международный формат Startup Huddle, в соответствии с которым мы организуем наши мероприятия, – это площадка для содержательного обсуждения того, как в рамках задач, которые решают стартапы, можно оказать им качественную поддержку. Задача мероприятия двусторонняя: по итогам 6-минутного питча руководителю проекта необходимо сформулировать запрос к экспертам, в чем ему нужна помощь, с какими сложностями он столкнулся, а экспертному сообществу предложить решения, дальнейшее взаимодействие, сотрудничество, ту или иную помощь в развитии компании. Экспертный фокус мероприятия хорошо зарекомендовал себя за год существования, многие из принимавших участие в клубе стартапов получили необходимую им поддержку» . Член совета генерального совета «Деловой России» и основатель бизнес digital-агентства INPRO.digital Виталий Арбузов также поделился: «Меня радует, когда все больше хороших серьезных компаний из разных сфер решают свои бизнес-цели с помощью веб-разработки, искусственного интеллекта. Это быстро развивающийся сегмент рынка, многие боятся сразу внедрять IT-технологии: долго думают, что-то проверяют, высчитывают, а за это время подход сменяется на уже новую версию. Такая площадка – уникальный шанс представить свой проект, получить советы, выстроить коммуникацию и заложить основы сотрудничества. Мне нравится, что здесь нет ограничения по стандартным критериям: например, по масштабности бизнеса или годовому обороту. Если идейный основатель придумал интересное решение, связанное с IT, веб-разработкой или искусственным интеллектом, то он всегда может им здесь поделится, получить экспертное мнение и найти единомышленников» . Генеральный директор «iPavlov», исполнительный директор НИЦ «Швабе» в МФТИ Лоран Акопян рассказал об инфраструктурном переходе к «Умному городу» 3.0 и о том, как, в рамках создания городов и элементов их экосистем, ИИ влияет на экономику и Большой Бизнес. Лоран отметил, что цифровые ассистенты, внедряемые в городскую инфраструктуру, оперируют множеством «суперсервисов». Компания предоставляет городу многофункциональную ИИ-платформу, на базе которой можно организовать систему «Умного города». Лоран также предсказал, что на рынках будущего (в формате «Нейронет») будут превалировать маленькие, подвижные компании, состоящие из нескольких человек, которые будут разрабатывать и применять умные решения на базе платформ, построенных промышленными гигантами. По его словам, Smart City 3.0 — это маркетплейс будущего, где любой житель/агент «Умного города» сможет взаимодействовать с городской инфраструктурой и другими жителями города свободно, что будет называться «цифровая демократия». Также Лоран Акопян представил проект «iPavlov Smart City: Умные города-курорты нового поколения». Платформа включает модули разработки, которые будут объединены в единую экосистему: инфраструктура, умное ЖКХ, ИТС, культура, умная клиника и др. Лоран обратил внимание на самый сложный аспект экосистемы — конфиденциальность данных, и прокомментировал способы, с помощью которых команда проекта справится с их защитой. CERA Маркетинг – видеоаналитика для ритейла Иван Смолин рассказал о технологии видеоаналитики CERA, которая помогает ритейлу увеличивать товарооборот за счет автоматизации ключевых бизнес-процессов, а также позволяет минимизировать возникновение очередей и повысить качество сервиса для покупателей. Видеокамеры, установленные рядом с кассами, непрерывно сканируют пространство, считая людей, и подают информацию администратору, если в зоне находится больше пяти человек. В этом случае принимается решение об открытии дополнительных касс или перераспределении потока покупателей на кассы самообслуживания. Программное обеспечение от CERA также детектирует состояние полки, распознает товары, пустоты и ассортимент. В случае отсутствия товара CERA проверяет его наличие на складе в магазине и направляет уведомление ответственному сотруднику. Amuleit – минимизация убытков компании при вспышках вирусных заболеваний среди сотрудников Александр Кожевников представил Amuleit, решение для актуальной проблемы: вспышек вирусных болезней внутри компаний. По его словам, отслеживание контактов – это надежный способ остановить распространение заболеваний, поэтому организации предоставляется комплексное коробочное решение, которое состоит из BLE-маячков (брелков) для сотрудников, BLE/LTE роутера для сбора данных и панели администрирования. Таким образом, Amuleit выполняет 2 задачи: обеспечение непрерывного отслеживания контактов и составление рекомендаций по предотвращению вспышки; блокировка очагов заболевания и прерывание цепочек распространения инфекции. Поисковый модуль «ДатиУм» Иван Мугалев, технический директор компании «ТехноИнтеллект», представил проект «ДатиУм», оперирующий на нефтегазовом, горнодобывающем и строительном рынках. «ДатиУм» — это поисковый модуль, решающий задачи сбора и унификации частей данных из гетерогенных источников в единую запись и формирующий уникальный набор экземпляров предметной области, который впоследствии предоставляет по запросу пользователей. Иван обратил внимание на основные кейсы, с которыми сталкивалась компания: поиск новых данных и категорирование существующих, классификация файловых архивов, оценка эффективности работ на скважинах и подбор режимов работы оборудования. ARKNET – система защиты компьютеров от взлома по подписке Викентий Францев рассказал о четырехфазной системе защиты ПК от взлома «ARKNET», которая поможет решить проблему кибератак, часто приводящую к большим финансовым потерям или даже банкротству компаний. Суть этой инновации заключается в применении фальшивой сети-ловушки и методов искусственного интеллекта для снижения количества ложных срабатываний и времени обнаружения взлома. По его словам, система защиты, адаптированная к особенностям технологического процесса, обнаруживает кибератаки в реальном времени за 30 секунд и автоматически вырабатывает наилучшие решения реагирования. Благодаря раннему обнаружению, объем финансовых потерь и стоимость ликвидации последствий снижаются на 90%. Виртуальный агроном «Greenbar» – ИИ управление фермой Анна Вититина представила проект интеллектуального управления фермой «Greenbar». В связи с ростом населения в мегаполисах, продовольственная проблема становится все актуальнее. Пытаясь ее решить, города находят новые ресурсы для производства еды, которая зачастую бывает некачественной и, по данным ВОЗ, является причиной многих серьезных заболеваний. По словам Анны, в будущем большинство людей будут жить в городах, поэтому станет необходимым выращивать продукты прямо в мегаполисах. Решением проблемы может стать вертикальное фермерство – автономные, экологичные конструкции для выращивания свежих овощей, зелени и ягод в любых помещениях. Сервисный центр контролирует работу ферм, а конечному пользователь приложения остается только засыпать семена и собрать урожай. Электронное правосудие с участием искусственного интеллекта Пётр Силантьев рассказал об уникальной системе электронного правосудия, которая основана на реальной юридической практике и применима для внедрения в других странах. С ее помощью получится изменить метод правоприменения с аналогового на цифровой, а также укрепить невозможность уклонения от оценки относимых доказательств в судебной системе. По его словам, это единственная комплексная система, основанная на антагонизме интересов участников процесса, формализующая и облегчающая работу, исключающая ошибки и злоупотребления, свойственные «палочной системе». При этом, в основе управления процессами при осуществлении правосудия остается человек, а искусственный интеллект лишь находит отличие от прецедента, не предполагая вмешательства в действия следователя и суда. Система предлагает оплачивать только те доказательства, которые в рамках исполнения своих процессуальных обязанностей отобрал судья, и они вошли в автоматически формируемую описательную часть судебного решения. График ближайших мероприятий: 18 марта – машиностроение; 1 апреля – утилизация отходов.

CERA Маркетинг – видеоаналитика для ритейла Иван Смолин рассказал о технологии видеоаналитики CERA, которая помогает ритейлу увеличивать товарооборот за счет автоматизации ключевых бизнес-процессов, а также позволяет минимизировать возникновение очередей и повысить качество сервиса для покупателей. Видеокамеры, установленные рядом с кассами, непрерывно сканируют пространство, считая людей, и подают информацию администратору, если в зоне находится больше пяти человек. В этом случае принимается решение об открытии дополнительных касс или перераспределении потока покупателей на кассы самообслуживания. Программное обеспечение от CERA также детектирует состояние полки, распознает товары, пустоты и ассортимент. В случае отсутствия товара CERA проверяет его наличие на складе в магазине и направляет уведомление ответственному сотруднику. Amuleit – минимизация убытков компании при вспышках вирусных заболеваний среди сотрудников Александр Кожевников представил Amuleit, решение для актуальной проблемы: вспышек вирусных болезней внутри компаний. По его словам, отслеживание контактов – это надежный способ остановить распространение заболеваний, поэтому организации предоставляется комплексное коробочное решение, которое состоит из BLE-маячков (брелков) для сотрудников, BLE/LTE роутера для сбора данных и панели администрирования. Таким образом, Amuleit выполняет 2 задачи: обеспечение непрерывного отслеживания контактов и составление рекомендаций по предотвращению вспышки; блокировка очагов заболевания и прерывание цепочек распространения инфекции. Поисковый модуль «ДатиУм» Иван Мугалев, технический директор компании «ТехноИнтеллект», представил проект «ДатиУм», оперирующий на нефтегазовом, горнодобывающем и строительном рынках. «ДатиУм» — это поисковый модуль, решающий задачи сбора и унификации частей данных из гетерогенных источников в единую запись и формирующий уникальный набор экземпляров предметной области, который впоследствии предоставляет по запросу пользователей. Иван обратил внимание на основные кейсы, с которыми сталкивалась компания: поиск новых данных и категорирование существующих, классификация файловых архивов, оценка эффективности работ на скважинах и подбор режимов работы оборудования. ARKNET – система защиты компьютеров от взлома по подписке Викентий Францев рассказал о четырехфазной системе защиты ПК от взлома «ARKNET», которая поможет решить проблему кибератак, часто приводящую к большим финансовым потерям или даже банкротству компаний. Суть этой инновации заключается в применении фальшивой сети-ловушки и методов искусственного интеллекта для снижения количества ложных срабатываний и времени обнаружения взлома. По его словам, система защиты, адаптированная к особенностям технологического процесса, обнаруживает кибератаки в реальном времени за 30 секунд и автоматически вырабатывает наилучшие решения реагирования. Благодаря раннему обнаружению, объем финансовых потерь и стоимость ликвидации последствий снижаются на 90%. Виртуальный агроном «Greenbar» – ИИ управление фермой Анна Вититина представила проект интеллектуального управления фермой «Greenbar». В связи с ростом населения в мегаполисах, продовольственная проблема становится все актуальнее. Пытаясь ее решить, города находят новые ресурсы для производства еды, которая зачастую бывает некачественной и, по данным ВОЗ, является причиной многих серьезных заболеваний. По словам Анны, в будущем большинство людей будут жить в городах, поэтому станет необходимым выращивать продукты прямо в мегаполисах. Решением проблемы может стать вертикальное фермерство – автономные, экологичные конструкции для выращивания свежих овощей, зелени и ягод в любых помещениях. Сервисный центр контролирует работу ферм, а конечному пользователь приложения остается только засыпать семена и собрать урожай. Электронное правосудие с участием искусственного интеллекта Пётр Силантьев рассказал об уникальной системе электронного правосудия, которая основана на реальной юридической практике и применима для внедрения в других странах. С ее помощью получится изменить метод правоприменения с аналогового на цифровой, а также укрепить невозможность уклонения от оценки относимых доказательств в судебной системе. По его словам, это единственная комплексная система, основанная на антагонизме интересов участников процесса, формализующая и облегчающая работу, исключающая ошибки и злоупотребления, свойственные «палочной системе». При этом, в основе управления процессами при осуществлении правосудия остается человек, а искусственный интеллект лишь находит отличие от прецедента, не предполагая вмешательства в действия следователя и суда. Система предлагает оплачивать только те доказательства, которые в рамках исполнения своих процессуальных обязанностей отобрал судья, и они вошли в автоматически формируемую описательную часть судебного решения. График ближайших мероприятий: 18 марта – машиностроение; 1 апреля – утилизация отходов.

Открывая встречу, председатель Startup клуба и гендиректор Центра предпринимательства Денис Дидковский прокомментировал: «Встречи Startup клуба каждые две недели в международном формате Startup Huddle стала хорошей традицией, которой мы придерживаемся. Сегодня нас ждут короткие 6-минутные выступления, максимально лаконично и коротко доносящие суть того, чем занимается компания, какую проблему и на каком рынке она решает, в каком конкурентном ландшафте находится, какие планы развития ставит, а также какие вызовы стоят сейчас перед компанией, какая поддержка требуется. В конце каждого выступления — 20 минут на сессию вопросов-ответов. По итогам мероприятия, надеюсь, участникам удастся обменяться полезными контактами и идеями, а также найти точки соприкосновения» . Во встрече в качестве спикеров и экспертов приняли участие члены генерального совета «Деловой России» Александр Масленников, Максим Авербух, Алексей Захаров, Андрей Кузубов, Виталий Арбузов, Эдуард Радославов, Алексей Шатров, Дмитрий Камерлохер, Максим Судаков, Наталья Кириллова, Александр Сегаль, Павел Савкин, Игорь Силин, Алексей Винниченко. Модератором выступил предприниматель, основатель и управляющий партнёр СОВЕТ#1 Семён Фомин. Участники представили шесть проектов. Производство высокопрочных износостойких деталей машин, узлов и элементов оборудования с использованием специальных сталей и сплавов Член генерального совета «Деловой России» Андрей Кузубов выступил с презентацией технологии создания износостойких изделий, которая позволяет повысить ресурс работы оборудования в 5–10 раз по сравнению со стандартно применяемыми  изделиями из сталей  и сплавов. Прочность изделий повышается за счет нанесения защитных покрытий  на базовую поверхность. Продукция нашла свое применение в отраслях добычи и обогащения полезных ископаемых, энергетики, производства строительных материалов, металлургии, производства сельскохозяйственной техники. Ранее аналогичные детали импортировались. Авторы проекта готовы к любым вариантам партнерства для развития продаж, а также хотят рассмотреть  с инвесторами распределение прибыли от новых контрактов  на партнерских условиях. Роботизированный комплекс изготовления конечного изделия полного цикла из композиционных материалов Компания члена генерального совета «Деловой России» Алексея Шатрова разрабатывает новые технологии промышленных производств. Приоритетный принцип компании — индивидуальность и уникальность каждого изделия вместо акцента на массовость производства. В производстве роботизированных комплексов команда проекта стремится к максимальной компактности и плотности продукции, снижению количества «соединений» и многофункциональности каждого узла. Компания ищет технологических партнеров, заказчиков готовых изделий и подобного оборудования. Разработка и производство приводных инструментальных блоков для станков с ЧПУ Александр Щеснович выступил с презентацией ПО «Иннотехмет», которое более 10 лет осуществляет производственную деятельность в области прецизионной металлообработки, изготавливая сложные корпусные детали из труднообрабатываемых жаропрочных сплавов. Сейчас компания готовится к выпуску серийной продукции на российский рынок и заинтересована в инвестициях. Внедрение новой технологии и оборудования для ремонта тележек грузовых вагонов Вадим Кодичев представил инициативу по совместной разработке комплексной программы по совершенствованию работы вагоноремонтного комплекса. Программа предполагает модернизацию существующих вагоноремонтных депо. Особенность технологии, которую предлагает компания, заключается в получении цифровых данных геометрического обмера деталей и передачи этой информации на последующие этапы технологического процесса. Это позволяет обеспечить оптимальную наплавку и необходимую точность механической обработки. Создание инновационных подшипников скольжения повышенной износостойкости как технологии для машиностроения Владимир Машников рассказал о компании «МАКСИМАЛ», которая занимается электрохимическим методами упрочнения поверхности деталей изготовленных из сплавов вентильной группы (алюминий, титан, тантал, цирконий и другие). Технология микродугового оксидирования позволяет получать многофункциональные керамикоподобное покрытие. Такие покрытия могут применяться в авиации и космонавтике, а также в автомобилестроении, нефтегазовой и угольной отрасли, электротехнике, радиотехнике и электронике, легкой промышленности, медицине, строительстве, энергетике и машиностроении. Блочная колесная пара «Гибкое колесо» Валерий Шилер представил проект гибкой транспортной системы. Его компания планирует внедрить высокоэффективную блочную колесную пару для грузовых и пассажирских вагонов железнодорожного транспорта. Реализация проекта позволит многократно повысить пропускную и провозную способность железных дорог при минимальных капитальных и эксплуатационных затратах в короткий промежуток времени. Команда проекта заинтересована в организации взаимодействия с Минтрансом, РЖД, производителями подвижного состава; разработке конструкторской документации; прохождении сертификации; изготовлении партии с внедрением в конструктив вагонов под наблюдением при эксплуатации и включении в стратегию развития транспортной системы РЖД. График ближайших мероприятий в 2021 году: 1 апреля — утилизация отходов; 15 апреля — туризм; 29 апреля — финтех.

Особенностью ВНП в Костромской ГСХА является участие в ней не только студентов разных курсов и факультетов нашего костромского вуза, но и студентов Красноярского ГАУ. Руководителем программы ВНП в Костромской ГСХА традиционно является Мамаева Ирина Алексеевна – помощник проректора по учебной работе (по инновационным технологиям обучения), которая убеждена в необходимости привлечения молодого поколения к участию в таком масштабном мероприятии и считает, что вуз для этого является отличной площадкой. В этом году программа ВНП-2020 в Костроме была исключительно разнообразной: мастер-классы, деловые игры, квесты, семинары, межрегиональный конкурс бизнес-планов и др. Участие в мероприятиях принимали студенты старших курсов, магистранты и аспиранты. Каждое мероприятие нашло своего слушателя или активного участника. Открылась Неделя мастер–классом по использованию Интернет-ресурса «Бизнес-навигатор», проведенным Васильковой Татьяной Максимовной – к.э.н., доцентом, руководителем информационно-консультационного центра ФГБОУ ВО Костромская ГСХА, заведующим кафедрой экономики, управления и техносферной безопасности. В качестве внешнего спикера в Неделе принял участие Романец Павел Викторович – заслуженный экономист России, академик Международной академии информатизации при ООН, генеральный директор «Центра независимых исследований и экспертиз» (г.Москва), который провел для аспирантов и магистрантов мастер-класс «Создание своего делового портрета». Еще одним приглашенным спикером стала Кулик Анна Александровна – эксперт по управлению бизнес-процессами, руководитель рекламного холдинга «Кулик-групп» (г.Кострома). Ею был проведен тренинг «Целевая аудитория и брендинг», который стал отправной точкой для поиска темы для следующего семинара. Ряд мероприятий для студентов старших курсов экономического факультета провели преподаватели экономического факультета Костромской ГСХА: -  конкурс «Аграрное предпринимательство» и семинар «1С Бухгалтерия»; - деловая игра «Стратегия развития малого бизнеса»; - онлайн-конкурс резюме; - семинар «Налоговый ликбез»; - квест «Создание крестьянского (фермерского) хозяйства». Кульминационным моментом недели стал межрегиональный конкурс «Бизнес-планирование как основа реализации предпринимательских идей», в котором приняли участие студенты Костромской ГСХА и Красноярского ГАУ. Конкурс проводился в онлайн режиме и позволил студентам успешно представить свои бизнес-проекты, познакомиться с работами своих сверстников из другого региона, а также проверить свои бизнес-идеи на реалистичность, окунуться в атмосферу предпринимательства, продемонстрировать знания особенностей исследуемых рынков продукции и умения презентовать производственные, организационные и финансовые показатели своего проекта. Все доклады были интересными, содержательными и вызвали бурное обсуждение не только членов жюри, но и присутствующих студентов. В рамках ВНП-2020 в Костромской ГСХА были использованы новые формы проведения мероприятий – небольшое количество участников в аудитории «плюс» онлайн-трансляция. Такой формат расширил количество участников и позволил ВНП стать профессиональной площадкой для развития предпринимательских знаний и умений студентов. Всего в мероприятиях ВНП приняли участие 167 студентов, магистрантов, аспирантов. И как отметили участники, «неделя прошла плодотворно, была полезной и увлекательной» .

В рамках него официальные представители власти, фондов и организаций, занимающихся развитием предпринимательства, а также уполномоченный по защите прав предпринимателей обсудили возможности для развития бизнеса и вызовы, которые ожидают тех, кто только задумывается об открытии своего дела. В конгресс-центре также прошло подписание договора между Центром предпринимательства, официальным организатором Всемирной недели предпринимательства в России, и Санкт-Петербургским отделением «ОПОРЫ РОССИИ» о сотрудничестве и оказании взаимной поддержки в организации и проведении тематических мероприятий в 2020. «В России по инициативе Центра предпринимательства и поддержке Минэкономразвития РФ проходит уже 12-я Всемирная неделя предпринимательства. Мы выражаем благодарность Санкт-Петербургскому отделению «ОПОРЫ РОССИИ» и Северо-Западному Бюро по защите прав предпринимателей за поддержку глобальной инициативы в Северной столице, ― сказал Денис Дидковский, генеральный директор ООО «Центр предпринимательства». ― Центр предпринимательства и «ОПОРА РОССИИ» создают условия для обмена знаниями и налаживания связей между лидерами региональных экосистем, так как считают это залогом успешных предпринимательских сообществ. Центром реализуются программы, способствующие формированию экосистемы предпринимательства, например, программа акселерации ScaleUp для действующих предпринимателей и – Startup Huddle, нацеленная на образование, развитие и сплочение стартап-сообществ. В рамках Недели, где развитие предпринимательских экосистем стало одной из центральных тем, мы стремимся вдохновить сообщества на сотрудничество для устойчивого развития бизнеса».

Первое место на конкурсе бизнес-проектов заняла Анастасия с идеей создания полезных сладостей. В качестве приза она получила грант в размере 100 000 рублей на воплощения своего проекта от благотворительного фонда Amway «В ответе за будущее». Федеральная образовательная программа по развитию женского предпринимательства «Мама-предприниматель» разработана специально для женщин в декрете и с несовершеннолетними детьми, чтобы помочь им открыть собственное дело и эффективно сочетать заботу о семье и профессиональную самореализацию. Программа существует с 2013 года и в этом году проходит более чем в 60 регионах России. С 2015 года программа реализуется благотворительным фондом Amway «В ответе за будущее» и Комитетом по развитию женского предпринимательства «ОПОРЫ РОССИИ», с 2016 года – вместе с акционерным обществом «Федеральная корпорация по развитию малого и среднего предпринимательства», а в 2019 году к совместному проекту присоединился банк «Открытие». В прошлом году программа «Мама-предприниматель» была включена Минэкономразвития России в перечень программ для предпринимателей, реализуемых в рамках национального проекта РФ «Малое и среднее предпринимательство и поддержка индивидуальной предпринимательской инициативы». Наталья Ларионова, статс-секретарь, заместитель генерального директора АО «Корпорация МСП»: «Самореализация – это, безусловно, один из главных факторов успешной и полноценной жизни современной женщины. В программе «Мама-предприниматель» мы стараемся показать, что начать собственное дело и совмещать его с заботой о семье – не настолько сложно и страшно, как может показаться на первый взгляд. По сути, мы даем алгоритм действий для старта, раскрываем секреты мира бизнеса, даем возможность действовать и идти вперед!» . Анна Сошинская, президент благотворительного фонда Amway «В ответе за будущее»: «Программа «Мама-предприниматель» – проект огромной социальной значимости. Более половины женщин в России рассматривают для себя возможность заняться предпринимательством, но большинству из них не хватает знаний в этой области или финансовых возможностей. А «Мама-предприниматель» может стать для них трамплином в счастливую жизнь, где не приходится выбирать между семьей и самореализацией. Из года в год мы видим, как благодаря программе сотни женщин обретают финансовую независимость и уверенность в своих силах. Именно поэтому фонд Amway «В ответе за будущее» поддерживает программу «Мама-предприниматель» уже много лет и не намерен прекращать!» . Надия Черкасова, заместитель президента-председателя правления банка «Открытие»: «Основные препятствия для начинающих предпринимателей при открытии своего бизнеса — нехватка стартового капитала и недостаток финансовых знаний. Программа “Мама-предприниматель” помогает участницам получить необходимые навыки для качественного старта, организации и ведения своего дела» . Финалу предшествовало пятидневное обучение основам предпринимательства. Из 150 заявок 35 жительниц Тверской области прошли региональный отборочный тур и получили возможность пройти тренинги и мастер-классы у бизнес-экспертов региона. Они обучались основам создания продукта и маркетинга, нюансам финансовой и налоговой грамотности, трудились над созданием собственного бизнес-плана и учились навыкам презентации проектов. В последний день обучения участницы представили жюри свои бизнес-идеи, среди которых было много уникальных и интересных проектов. ___ Об организаторах: Федеральная корпорация по развитию малого и среднего предпринимательства Федеральная корпорация по развитию малого и среднего предпринимательства была создана в июне 2015 года по указу Президента РФ как единая платформа для поддержки и развития малого и среднего предпринимательства в России. Основной целью Корпорации является координация оказания поддержки субъектам МСП, в том числе финансовой, маркетинговой, юридической и пр., а также совершенствование нормативно-правового регулирования в этой сфере. Корпорация осуществляет множество инициатив, направленных на развитие сектора МСП в России, таких как бизнес-навигатор, реестр субъектов МСП в России и многие другие. Так, большую популярность среди владельцев бизнеса, а также тех, кто только планирует открыть свое дело, приобрел Бизнес-навигатор МСП.

        "parsed_text": "Center for Entrepreneurship  About Global Entrepreneurship Week 10 million people. 40,000 activities. 200 countries. One week. Removing barriers + empowering all. Global Entrepreneurship Week is a massive campaign to celebrate and empower entrepreneurs in every country and community around the world – especially those individuals who face structural barriers or may have never considered the idea of launching a startup. Each November, 10 million people take part in tens of thousands of activities, competitions and events that inspire them to act and provide them with the knowledge, experience and connections they need to succeed.  Global Entrepreneurship Week reaches beyond high-tech startup hubs like Silicon Valley, London and Shanghai. It envisions one entrepreneurial ecosystem open to all, including smaller cities in emerging economies and under-represented communities, whether systemically marginalized, geographically hard-to-reach or otherwise pushed aside or left out. National campaigns are driven by local event organizers who plan activities tailored to their community’s needs. Activities can range from small, local gatherings to massive international competitions – or anything in between.  While GEW only takes place one week each year, the connections made are long-lasting. The campaign serves as an opportunity to collaborate and engage with organizations and individuals to celebrate and spotlight entrepreneurs, expose people to the path of entrepreneurship, help them get started and facilitate access to capital and the resources to grow.  Global Entrepreneurship Week is powered by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and supported by a range of strategic partners including corporate sponsors like FedEx, entrepreneurship support organizations like Endeavor Global and JA Worldwide, a diverse collection of national host organizations and 25,000 local event organizers.  The Global Entrepreneurship Network operates programs, like Global Entrepreneurship Week, that make it easier for anyone, anywhere to start and scale a company. GEN divides its programs into four distinct categories: those that celebrate entrepreneurs and inspire others to follow in their footsteps; those intended to better understand the underlying conditions that best enable entrepreneurs to thrive; those that support entrepreneurs through proven policy and programmatic interventions; and those that connect entrepreneurs, ecosystem builders and community leaders to strengthen local ecosystems around the world.",

        "parsed_text": "To strengthen global startup ecosystems and catalyze U.S. business expansion in emerging markets, the U.S. Department of State, in close collaboration with leading U.S. startup accelerators, formed StartOpps, a public-private partnership operating at the intersection of the shared goals of top U.S. startup accelerators and the U.S. Department of State. The partnership was created with the objective of amplifying startup opportunities worldwide.  Entrepreneurship is a pillar upon which the U.S. leads the world in addressing critical economic, social, and development challenges.  The founding partners are Y Combinator , Techstars , Entrepeneurs Roundtable Accelerator (ERA) , and Silicon Valley Group (SVG) Ventures .  Under the purview of StartOpps, the THRIVE Africa Challenge  is a partnership between Silicon Valley Group Ventures and the Office of Global Partnerships. The Challenge aims to enable the needed transformations in Africa’s food value chain. It will accomplish this by identifying, promoting, accelerating, and investing in innovative early-stage African startups that are creating new and alternative paths for a more efficient and sustainable global food system.  If your organization wants to explore partnering with the U.S. Department of State on StartOpps email us at Partnerships@state.gov. The network of industry leaders aspires to link solutions and policymakers to global opportunities.  Context Startups provide much needed innovative and game-changing solutions while driving job growth, creating millions of new jobs a year in the United States alone.  Now more than ever, and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we see startups emerge and respond to specific crises and problems, new demands, and gaps in the market.  By identifying and pursuing new business opportunities, startups generate economic value, create jobs, and accelerate recovery and development.  At the same time, startups are less likely to understand how to easily navigate U.S. and other government resources and international expansion or collaboration.  Venture accelerators and ecosystem builders who support startups also have unique barriers to overcome around access to international applicants, local information, markets, and other resources.  By offering support through capacity building, technical assistance, and network building, the U.S. Department of State and its partners can help both accelerators and startups engage relevant stakeholders, refine their programs, and then help scale their portfolio companies’ technologies and solutions for greater impact.  Concept The main goal of StartOpps is to build and deploy strategic partnerships between American and global venture accelerators to: foster dialogue through connectivity; promote and facilitate new investments; and foster innovative business models.  StartOpps will also explore opportunities for American and global accelerators to engage with the Department to meet the shared mission of a more democratic, secure, and prosperous world through economic statecraft.  StartOpps will promote the following 3Cs of engagement to promote global prosperity: Connect, Catalyze, and Collaborate.  StartOpps will engage its partners thru the following modalities:  Connect | Connecting the",

During one week each November, GEW inspires people everywhere through local, national and global activities designed to help them take the next step in their entrepreneurial journey. These activities, from large-scale competitions and events to intimate networking gatherings, connect participants to potential collaborators, mentors and even investors — introducing them to new possibilities and exciting opportunities.    Where is Global Entrepreneurship Week happening?   Everywhere. Global Entrepreneurship Week is not one single event — it is tens of thousands of events, activities and competitions happening in 180 countries.   Who can get involved in Global Entrepreneurship Week?  Anybody. Anywhere. Anytime. Organizations can get involved in a variety of capacities— planning events and activities as a local partner or even coordinating the initiative for an entire country as a GEW host. Individuals interested in exploring their entrepreneurial potential can find a broad array of activities—from local events to global competitions. Entrepreneurs and investors can share their ideas and experiences—face-to-face or online. How you get involved is up to you. If you want a little guidance, connect with the Host for your country. If there is not a Host for your country, please contact us to suggest one.    Why should you plan or schedule an activity during Global Entrepreneurship Week?  By hosting an event or activity during Global Entrepreneurship Week you have a positive—and potentially life-changing—impact on aspiring and nascent entrepreneurs, moving them along the spectrum from simply having idea to actually launching a startup. In addition, these activities help recognize and celebrate the contributions made to your community by local entrepreneurs. More directly, planning one or more events during GEW also has some tangible benefits for you and your organization: Raise awareness of your organization and gain recognition for the work you do throughout the year. Reach new audiences within your community, potentially identifying talented volunteers or even new employees. Enhance your leadership profile within the entrepreneurial ecosystem of your city, state, region or country. Strengthen connections with existing supporters and sponsors by providing them with more visibility for them.    How can I connect with other people involved in Global Entrepreneurship Week?  In addition to connecting face-to-face during GEW events and activities, participants can continue their conversations year-round through a handful of official GEW social media channels:",

Эксперты клуба рассмотрели восемь проектов. С приветствием к участникам встречи обратился руководитель направления «Робототехника и искусственный интеллект» ИТ-кластера фонда «Сколково» Павел Кривозубов. «Тематика самая актуальная, особенно в свете последних событий, вызовов, которые нам дал последний год. Во всех сферах идет трансформация, в том числе с помощью систем искусственного интеллекта», — отметил он. Председатель Startup клуба, член генерального совета «Деловой России» и генеральный директор Центра предпринимательства Денис Дидковский напомнил, что клуб работает уже почти год, за 19 прошедших встреч он стал эффективной площадкой для тех, кто ищет экспертную помощь в реализации не только пилотных, но и  достаточно «зрелых» проектов, а также для тех, кто заинтересован в привлечении инвестиций. Модератором встречи выступил партнер CBI Pioneer, эксперт по инвестиционной привлекательности и региональным институтам развития Дмитрий Ягодкин. Участники представили восемь проектов. Интеллектуальный пешеходный переход Кирилл Минибаев представил проект интеллектуального пешеходного перехода, который предупреждает пешеходов о высокой скорости приближающегося автомобиля, а водителей — о том, что на пешеходном переходе находится человек. Специальные технологии обеспечивают максимальную видимость пешеходного перехода для всех участников движения. Системы компьютерного зрения Smart Timber Татьяна Елисеева рассказала о сервисе для подсчета объема срубленного леса, уложенного в штабель или в лесовоз. Сейчас на предприятиях лесной промышленности гораздо чаще используется ручной труд, а имеющиеся автоматизированные решения недостаточно гибкие. Smart Timber использует технологии компьютерного зрения и машинного обучения для автоматизации процесса подсчета объема древесины. Команда проекта ищет контакты потенциальных заказчиков и партнеров для решения смежных задач. IPG — система слот-координации для аэропортов Алексей Цыплаков выступил с презентацией платформы по созданию решений для планирования и оптимизации управления ресурсами на основе слот-координации. Существующие экспертные системы управления ресурсами не могут создать наиболее оптимальный результат в условиях большого количества ограничений и ресурсов. Предлагаемая система на основе искусственного интеллекта способна создавать модели для получения результата, который можно рассчитать и который должен удовлетворять множеству условий, включая взаимоисключающие. Такой сервис может быть полезен для аэропортов, спортивных лиг, строительных компаний, крупных учебных и медицинских организаций. AURORAi — система мониторинга сложных технических объектов Василий Манько представил решение, которое использует алгоритмы машинного обучения, совмещенные с компонентами компьютерного зрения, что позволяет определять техническое состояние объектов в ходе производственного процесса. Система поможет автоматизировать процессы, которые раньше мог проводить только человек, например, диагностику состояния колесной пары и навесного оборудования, описание рудного материала в горнодобывающей промышленности и другие. Компания ищет выходы на новые рынки, заказчиков и инвесторов. Oz Forensics — биометрические платформы Светлана Ефимова рассказала о биометрической платформе, которая может проверять подлинность изображения, сравнивать лица, определять живого человека в кадре. Спикер отметила, что потери от идентификационного мошенничества в мире в 2019 году достигли 16,9 млрд долл. Авторы проекта обещают защитить своих клиентов от идентификационного мошенничества с точностью до 99,87%. Создание диалоговых систем и систем умного поиска на базе ИИ Артем Артемов выступил с презентацией языкового процессора B2NLP, функционал которого он описал так: «Превращает текстовые данные в ценные знания». Авторы проекта ориентируются в основном на государственный сектор и предлагают решения на основе своей разработки для анализа обращений граждан, умного поиска по документам, анализа медиаполя. Компания ищет выход на потребителей и пилотные проекты с заинтересованным в результате посредником. Платформа «Цифровая Россия» Максим Шевченко представил сервис для решения бизнес-запросов «Цифровая Россия». Это единая платформа для взаимодействия всех участников рынка от бизнес-сообществ до институтов развития. Платформа помогает решать задачи нетворкинга, поиска исполнителей, поиска потенциальных клиентов и развития бизнеса. Проект заинтересован в информационной и финансовой поддержке, а также сотрудничестве с институтами развития и предпринимательскими сообществами. Сооснователем проекта является член генерального совета «Деловой России» Алексей Мостовщиков. Виртуальные цифровые ассистенты iPavlov: корпоративный нейроинтеллект большого бизнеса Лоран Акопян рассказал о компании iPavlov как успешном проекте, который проделал путь от стартапа до зрелой компании. В портфель проектов компании входят пять продуктов: чат-бот-платформа iPavlov, компьютерное зрение, технологии для цифрового здравоохранения, нейрокриптография — аппаратные и программные способы защиты информации. Все платформы интегрируются с наиболее популярными внешними системами. На правах сложившегося бизнеса компания iPavlov выразила готовность делиться с участниками Startup клуба опытом привлечения инвестиций. it стартапы резиденты ru Clusters IT BioMed Energy Nuclear Space Technopark About Technopark Офисы и лаборатории Services R&D Services Contacts Education Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology International gymnasium Accommodation Apartments Cottages Townhouses Infrastructure Customs and Finance Company Intellectual property centre COMMUNICATIONS Press User Agreement Contacts © 2024 Skolkovo Foundation",

This skill development is essential for the mentee's long-term success.  3. Networking Opportunities A mentor often has an extensive professional network that they can introduce to the mentee. These connections can open doors to potential partnerships, investors, clients, and other opportunities that might otherwise be inaccessible. Building a strong network is critical for business growth and sustainability.  4. Personal Growth and Confidence Regular interaction with a mentor can boost the mentee's confidence and self-esteem. Overcoming challenges with the mentor's support helps build resilience and a positive mindset, essential traits for any successful entrepreneur.  5. Problem-Solving and Innovation Having a mentor allows the mentee to discuss challenges and brainstorm solutions, leading to innovative ideas and approaches. The mentor's experience provides a fresh perspective, often revealing new ways to tackle problems and seize opportunities.  6. Moral and Emotional Support Entrepreneurship can be a lonely and stressful journey. A mentor offers moral support and encouragement, helping the mentee stay motivated during tough times. This emotional support can be a critical factor in maintaining the mentee's mental well-being and perseverance.  7. Long-Term Business Growth With the mentor's guidance, the mentee can avoid common pitfalls and make informed decisions, leading to more sustainable business growth. The long-term relationship allows the mentor to provide continuous support as the business evolves, adapting strategies to meet changing market conditions.  8. Enhanced Innovation and Creativity A mentor can inspire the mentee to think outside the box and explore new ideas. This encouragement fosters a culture of innovation within the mentee's business, driving competitive advantage and long-term success.  9. Mutual Learning and Growth The mentorship relationship is mutually beneficial. While the mentee gains from the mentor's experience and knowledge, the mentor can also learn from the mentee's fresh perspective and new approaches. This exchange of ideas can lead to personal and professional growth for both parties.  In summary, the Center for Entrepreneurship growth programs are transformative experience, offering a blend of practical advice, emotional support, and strategic guidance. By leveraging the mentor's experience and network, the mentee can significantly enhance their chances of building a successful and sustainable business.",

The Center offers high impact programs for existing entreprenuers like ScaleUp accelerator and also startup programs The Importance of a Professional Team in Running an Accelerator In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, the role of accelerators has become increasingly pivotal. These entities provide crucial support to startups, offering resources, mentorship, and networks that can significantly enhance the chances of success for budding entrepreneurs. However, the true efficacy of an accelerator program hinges on the quality and professionalism of the team running it. Here are several reasons why a professional team is indispensable for the success of an accelerator.  1. Expertise and Experience A professional team brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table. They understand the intricacies of startup ecosystems and are adept at navigating the challenges that new businesses face. Their expertise spans various domains, including business strategy, marketing, finance, and technology. This diverse skill set allows them to provide comprehensive support to startups, addressing their unique needs effectively.  2. Credibility and Trust The reputation of an accelerator is significantly influenced by the caliber of its team. A professional team with a proven track record instills confidence in startups, investors, and other stakeholders. This credibility is essential for attracting high-potential startups and securing investment opportunities. Startups are more likely to join an accelerator if they trust the team's ability to guide them toward success.  3. Network and Connections One of the most valuable assets a professional team brings to an accelerator is their network. They have established connections with industry leaders, investors, mentors, and potential customers. These relationships can open doors for startups, providing them with opportunities that would otherwise be difficult to access. A well-connected team can facilitate strategic partnerships, funding rounds, and market entry, accelerating the growth trajectory of startups.  4. Tailored Mentorship Every compamy is unique, with its own set of challenges and opportunities. A professional team is skilled at providing tailored mentorship, offering insights and guidance specific to each startup's context. This personalized approach ensures that startups receive relevant advice and support, maximizing their chances of overcoming obstacles and achieving their goals.  5. Operational Efficiency Running an accelerator requires meticulous planning and execution. A professional team ensures operational efficiency, managing the various components of the program seamlessly. From selecting and onboarding startups to organizing workshops and events, they handle the logistics with precision. This efficiency allows startups to focus on their core business activities, knowing that the accelerator's operations are in capable hands.  6. Long-Term Impact The goal of an accelerator is not just to provide short-term support but to create long-term impact. A professional team is committed to the sustained success of startups. They offer post-accelerator support, helping startups navigate the critical phases of scaling and expansion. This ongoing relationship fosters a sense of community and continuity, contributing to the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem.  Conclusion The importance of a professional team in running an accelerator cannot be overstated. Center for Entreprenuership  expertise, credibility, network, tailored mentorship, operational efficiency, and commitment to long-term impact are essential ingredients for the success of both the accelerator and the startups it supports. In an environment where startups face numerous challenges, the guidance and support of a professional team can be the difference between success and failure. For accelerators aiming to make a meaningful impact, investing in a professional team is not just an option�it is a necessity.",

        "parsed_text": "    What is a startup accelerator? January 15, 2023 There are two types of accelerators: accelerator for startups and for existing entrepreneurs. The most popular is startup accelerator.  There are over 200 startup accelerator programs in the United States  many more globally  and they differ in approach, focus, cost and effectiveness. The well-respected <a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Y Combinator</a> and SVBs partner, <a href=\"https://www.techstars.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Techstars</a>, are investor funded and work primarily with tech startups. Others are sponsored by universities, in the case of <a href=\"https://www.startx.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford Universitys StartX</a>, or by corporations  the latter is particularly true for healthcare startups.  Private startup accelerators can provide funding, and the money helps cover early-stage business expenses as well as travel and living expenses for the three-month residency at the in-person startup accelerators. However, the funds and guidance come at a price. Just like any other equity funding, signing an accelerator agreement typically means <a href=\"https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/startup-equity/startup-equity-dilution/\" target=\"_blank\">giving up a slice of your company</a>. Startup accelerators generally take 5% to 10% of your equity in exchange for training and a relatively small amount of funding.  There is another type of accelerator (less popular), when its focus is not on new startup companies but rather on growth of existing companies. The Center for Entrepreneurship implements two types of programs. The ScaleUp accelerator is for existing entrepreneurs who are willing to grow existing business. The Startup Club program is for new startups.  ",

Programs like Techstars and Y Combinator are often highlighted for their extensive networks and successful alumni. For instance, Techstars has supported over 2,300 companies that have collectively raised more than $12 billion in funding. On the other hand, Y Combinator has an impressive list of graduates, including Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe.

First-time founders usually need a lot of support, and an accelerator can help you by: Providing a playbook from past startups, Making connections to investors, Explaining the best ways to pitch, Showing what a fund-raising cycle looks like. Accelerators can also connect you to subject matter experts to help you achieve product/market fit or even help you develop a go-to-market plan. Success stories abound. 'I’m not sure we would have made it without <a href='https://www.techstars.com/'>Techstars</a>', says <a href='https://www.evertrue.com/people/brent-grinna'>Brent Grinna</a>, co-founder and CEO of EverTrue. In the years following its participation in the startup accelerator program, the company raised roughly $25 million in venture funding. However, you need to choose carefully so you don’t end up giving away your time and equity in exchange for off-the-shelf help. While top programs boast of a large roster of well-known graduates, the number of successful exits and amounts raised drop off rapidly, according to reports in GrowthMentor and <a href='https://www.seed-db.com/accelerators'>Seed-DB</a>. <a href='https://www.seed-db.com/'>The Center for Entrepreneurship</a> is providing startup programs like <a href='/programs/startup-club'>Startup Club</a> and <a href='/programs/startup-huddle'>Startup Huddle</a> since 2016. More than 90% of participants reported that they saw substantial value in the programs.</p><h4 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>The Importance of Choosing the Right Accelerator</h4><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>Choosing the right startup accelerator can be a game-changer. Programs like Techstars and Y Combinator are often highlighted for their extensive networks and successful alumni. For instance, Techstars has supported over 2,300 companies that have collectively raised more than $12 billion in funding. On the other hand, Y Combinator has an impressive list of graduates, including Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe. These accelerators provide a robust support system and resources that can significantly aid in the growth of a startup. However, it's critical to evaluate an accelerator’s track record, the equity they take, and the specific benefits they offer.

Overly wordy or buzzword-filled applications will get passed over for a lack of clarity. Keep your application focused and easy to follow. A succinct application can help you move on to the accelerator investment board and give you another opportunity to demonstrate you have a viable product and a team that can make your pitch a reality.</p><h4 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Key Organizations Supporting Entrepreneurs</h4><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>The Center for Entrepreneurship offers two pivotal programs: the <a href='https://cfeglobal.org/programs/scaleup-acceleration-program'>ScaleUp accelerator</a> and <a href='https://cfeglobal.org/programs/startup-club'>Startup Club</a>.

Here are a few examples:  Strong team       Who will lead your business to success? Startup      accelerators arent just looking for solid product ideas. They are also      looking for a strong, capable team with business-building skills and      cohesive dynamics that can succeed past the accelerator. What is it in      your founding teams background that gives them the unique insight needed      to start the business? And how does their background equip them with the      skills thatll be needed to build a successful business in this      space?  Valuable      concept  What value is your company going      to create? Although your product does not yet need to be market-ready, you      need to demonstrate why the concept is something people want. If not,      startup accelerators wont show much interest.   Competitive      advantage  What sets your business apart?      What makes you memorable? And equally important, can you describe your      unique selling and value propositions in one or two sentences?  Coachability       Will you follow expert opinions about your business, product and growth?      This is critical, and you can demonstrate it during your investor meetings      by asking for advice on your current challenges and gathering other      constructive feedback. Humility, too, can be an important asset when      writing a successful application.   Potential      market size  Its OK to be a small      business.

There are many reasons an accelerator may decide youre not a good fit that have nothing to do with the validity of your business concept. Many companies have found success using bootstrap tactics and funding sources that are available outside an accelerator:   Early seed      funding       This money comes from your personal savings, home equity and <a href=\"https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/raising-capital/raising-startup-funds-friends-and-family/\" target=\"_blank\">family and friends</a> who      have confidence in your idea and abilities.  Venture      capital       VCs exchange equity in your company for capital. The equity percentage is      negotiable and is usually based on your valuation. If you can demonstrate      high growth potential, <a href=\"https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/ready-to-raise/VC-funding-things-you-lose/\" target=\"_blank\">VCs will be eager to become involved</a>,      and they may be even more attracted if you have been part of an      accelerator.  Partner      financing       A strategic industry partner may be interested in helping fund your growth      in exchange for special access to your product, staff, distribution      rights, or some combination of those items. This option acts much like a      venture capital investment because usually a percentage of your equity      transfers to the partner, although it can also be royalty-based  a case      in which the partner gets a percentage of every product sale.  Angel      investor       These <a href=\"https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/raising-capital/how-to-find-the-right-angel-investors/\" target=\"_blank\">individuals invest in startup</a> or      early-stage businesses that may not yet have the demonstrable growth that      a VC is looking for. Usually, they will also provide help and guidance to      give your company  and their investment  its best chance at      success.   Grants       Depending on the nature of your product, government grants may be      available, particularly in the life sciences (see our article on <a href=\"https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/startup-strategy/Life-science-startup-hubs-Advantages-of-New-York/\" target=\"_blank\">New York</a>). However, grants can be      complicated to apply for, and recipients must meet research and      development goals and have a high potential for commercialization.   All businesses need capital to survive, and there are other ways to secure the funding you need without an accelerator. In any scenario, fundraising requires a serious time commitment. But with a <a href=\"https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/startup-strategy/how-to-create-investor-pitch-deck-vc-angels/\" target=\"_blank\">precise pitch deck</a> and a strategy that targets investors most likely to be interested in your project, you can achieve success.  Center for Entrepreneurship offers great acceleration alternative: the  <a href=\"https://cfeglobal.org/programs/startup-club\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color:var(--theme-anchor-hover-color);font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; word-spacing:0px\">Startup Club</a>.   <a href=\"https://cfeglobal.org/programs/startup-club\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;text-rendering: optimizelegibility; color:var(--theme-anchor-hover-color);font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; word-spacing:0px\">Startup Club</a>, launched globally in 2020, is an international program dedicated to supporting entrepreneurs from communities in 18 specific industries.

Each November, 10 million people take part in tens of thousands of activities, competitions and events that inspire them to act and provide them with the knowledge, experience and connections they need to succeed. Global Entrepreneurship Week reaches beyond high-tech startup hubs like Silicon Valley, London and Shanghai. It envisions one entrepreneurial ecosystem open to all, including smaller cities in emerging economies and under-represented communities, whether systemically marginalized, geographically hard-to-reach or otherwise pushed aside or left out. National campaigns are driven by local event organizers who plan activities tailored to their communitys needs. Activities can range from small, local gatherings to massive international competitions  or anything in between. While GEW only takes place one week each year, the connections made are long-lasting.   Key Organizations Supporting Global Entrepreneurship Week Center for Entrepreneurship has supported the Global Entrepreneurship Week  since its first year. A diverse collection of national host organizations and 25,000 local event organizers contribute to the success of this initiative. These organizations play a crucial role in celebrating and spotlighting entrepreneurs, exposing people to the path of entrepreneurship, helping them get started and facilitating access to capital and resources to grow. The <a href=\"https://cfeglobal.org/partners/global-entrepreneurship-network\">Global Entrepreneurship Network</a> operates programs like Global Entrepreneurship Week that make it easier for anyone, anywhere to start and scale a company, further strengthening entrepreneurial ecosystems worldwide.

They have cracked the formula for repeatable sales, have the right team, and are ready to expand into new markets or channels. Scaleups not only create jobs; they disrupt the market and their industry with innovations and nontraditional business models.  However, scaling up requires a different mindset  and skill set  than starting up.

In return, scaleups encounter new challenges that must be sorted out to move forward  such as: <?if !supportLists?>·       Constraints on growth: Identifying and removing internal business model constraints on growth involve a rigorous approach that includes small-scale experimentation. <?if !supportLists?>·       Freedom versus standardization: While no one wants to lose the magic of the startup, scaleup must maintain a delicate balance between freedom and standardization to remain viable.

This program is not like others. It is easy to grow your existing business with the <a href='/programs/scaleup-acceleration-program'>Center for Entrepreneurship ScaleUp</a>. Scaleups are on an upward trajectory despite current economic conditions. After all, they are known for their agility and ability to pivot quickly in response to changing circumstances. These businesses have transitioned from the uncertainty of the startup phase and are on their way to more stable, sustained growth. They have cracked the formula for repeatable sales, have the right team, and are ready to expand into new markets or channels. Scaleups not only create jobs; they disrupt the market and their industry with innovations and nontraditional business models. However, scaling up requires a different mindset and skill set than starting up. Companies can lose some of the nimbleness of the startup phase while not yet achieving the relative stability of a large enterprise. In return, scaleups encounter new challenges that must be sorted out to move forward such as constraints on growth. Identifying and removing internal business model constraints on growth involve a rigorous approach that includes small-scale experimentation. Freedom versus standardization. While no one wants to lose the magic of the startup, scaleup must maintain a delicate balance between freedom and standardization to remain viable. For example, rules on which platform is used to communicate are imposed while payroll activities are governed by a predefined, auditable workflow. Skills mismatch. Sometimes, people who are instrumental during the startup phase do not have the skills and discipline needed for the scaleup phase. These exits are not easy, but having the right people in place at the right time is essential to success. Lost culture. Because the workforce has changed and expanded rapidly, sometimes from 10 to 100 to 1,000 employees, disorganization, fuzzy goals, and a lack of workforce unity often arise. The program is essential to fast and significant growth. Scaleups are more than just glorified startups. And by overcoming unique challenges and adopting the right strategies along the way, scaleups can achieve significant growth and drive job creation and innovation in modern commerce. Adopting the right program and skills at the right time is crucial for successful scaling. <a href='/partners/ewing-marion-kauffman-foundation'>Center for Entrepreneurship</a> invites you to apply for the 2025 ScaleUp program.</p><h4 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Key Program Benefits</h4><p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'>Why join the program?

Even though still in his 30s, hed already built eight businesses. And yet, none had fully prepared him for Route.  Born out of his frustration with shipping a vintage trunk from Europe to the United States, Walker developed <a href=\"https://route.com/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; transition: color 0.25s ease 0s;background:unset;padding-bottom:0.125rem\" target=\"_blank\">Route</a> as an easier way for consumers to protect and track e-commerce packages. He planned to fine-tune the product, raise a seed round to find traction and then head into a Series A to accelerate growth. Route would pick up both retailers and their customers along the way.  In January 2019, Walker, who is Routes founder and was the CEO at the time, closed a $1.3 million seed round to carry the company through mid-2020.  Within months of launch, demand for Routes tracking platform went through the roof, upending Walkers well-laid plans. The money Route had in the bank was meant to last 18 months, not to be spent immediately on a quick ramp-up of business operations. Walker was caught between two venture funding maxims  spend wisely to extend your startups runway or spend quickly to accelerate growth. In a strategic move (and out of necessity from growth), Walker decided to grow fast and deploy Routes capital in just four months, in essence, taking on the profile of a Series A company just as it was coming off a seed round.  It was a little bit riskier of a move, but going down to four months was very calculated, says Walker. It was done deliberately knowing that the shortened runway was going to create faster growth.  From fast to faster To keep the flywheel going, Walker raised additional capital through a quick succession of convertible notes that played the role of a typical Series A funding round.  My advice to founders and entrepreneurs is to look at the competitive landscape because there's so many businesses starting up. If you don't raise money, your competition will.\"  The gambit paid off: Route hit a $14.4 million annualized run rate in its first year.This was my eighth business and the first VC-funded company, says Walker. My advice to founders and entrepreneurs is to look at the competitive landscape because there's so many businesses starting up. If you don't raise money, your competition will and they're going to have a strategic advantage. In other words, moving fast is critical to your startups success.     Other ways to accelerate Center for Entrepreneurship Scaleup programs is a starting point for anyone who is considering taking the leap to start a company.

        "parsed_text": "    Hiring when Scaling February 10, 2024   As business begin to scale, the importance of hiring the best possible talent cant be underestimated. While there are many aspects of growth to consider, ensuring you secure the most effective team available will make other goals much easier to realise. An A-grade team also attracts other benefits and helps to build strong foundations for long-term growth in a self-reinforcing circle. Over-hire, dont under-hire Always hire the best talent you can as these team members will be the highest performers. Talent assets will also aid in attracting capital and further talent. Poor hiring decisions end up costing in lost time, revenue and traction. Although it is possible for an A-grade team to improve a B-grade product, it is worth remembering that an A-grade product can be destroyed by a B-grade team.  Husayn Kassai, CEO and Co-Founder at Onfido, gives this advice: Any business is just the sum of its people, so if theres one rule we should all swear by, its to be very selective. You need to know exactly what you want and be relentless in your drive to find the best possible candidate to achieve that. A common mistake startups make is not knowing what role they need to hire for and worse, settling for someone whos not best suited to it. When businesses are scaling, theres often a tension between urgently needing to fill a gap and finding someone whos the right fit for it  compromising on the latter is one of the biggest mistakes a business can make.    Utilise all resources to secure the best people Your investors have already recognised your potential and will likely have some prior knowledge of your sector.  Asking them to utilise their networks to support you with your hiring can provide a fast track to highly suitable and experienced talent for your business. Investors are unlikely to recommend anyone who would not perform well and there is nothing more powerful than a VC/Angel eyeballing a potential candidate. Heroes dont scale By this stage, you are already likely to possess a strong existing executive team.  As you begin to scale, the CEO needs to maintain a focus on the broader picture. The CEO should ensure that the other executives in HR, Finance and Sales are performing their roles effectively, allowing the principal to stay focused on the business strategy and path to exit and not get distracted from the core business.   Other ways to accelerate Center for Entrepreneurship Scaleup programs is a starting point for anyone who is considering taking the leap to start a company.

Before embarking on this journey, it's crucial to evaluate the sturdiness of your vessel  your startup's foundation. This evaluation is not just about ensuring that the numbers add up; it's about taking a holistic view of your business and asking the hard questions. Is your team ready to expand? Do your processes have the capacity to handle increased demand? Is your product truly market-ready, or does it need further refinement? These questions are essential because scaling too soon can be just as detrimental as scaling too late.
